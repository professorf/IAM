The monograph for Zolpidem states that the Area under the curve is increased 45% in females(Lexi-Drugs).Which means that females are exposed longer to the drug’s effects. While that is not a justification for Mrs. Barr’s actions, her actions very well could have been attributed by the side effects of the Ambien. Also, clearance of the drug is slower in women. 
A question that came to my mind while reading the article is, does Mrs. Barr have a hepatic impairment. That would increase the half-life of the drug and have those “unwanted” side effect around longer. Roseanne’ has always tried to push the envelope with her comedy style. I remember watching her TV show and some the comedy was a little crass. She has many controversies through her life and I believe this tweeting antic was her attempt at “comedy”.
The half-life of Ambien is about 2.5 hours. If Ambien is used like it was intended, then a person can get full nights rest since it will take anywhere from 7-11hrs to clear 95% of the drug. Some side effects of the drug are: abnormal thinking, behavioral changes, sleep related activities. Like the article said racism is not a known side effect of Ambien. (Hauser, C.)

Paul,
Your discussion post made me want to look up area under the curve (“AUC”) another time to refresh my recollection. According to the video, AUC on a concentration versus time graph is proportional to the amount of drug absorbed. In the case of Ambien, another way of stating this AUC increase for women could be that they have greater drug amount absorbed for a particular dosage ingested. Do you agree with my interpretation of the concept?I was curious about her hepatic function as well. Judging by her appearance alone, her excess body weight could be resulting in diabetes and/or hypertension and in turn affecting her liver function. If her clearance rate was slower related to decreased liver function, like you say, she is more susceptible to experiencing next-day effects.

I do agree with your statement our book says ""the total AUC reflects the absorption of the drug""(Whalen). the point i was trying to get to was that with a larger AUC ,in this case, the longer the Ambien was in her body forcing her to make racist comments. it was also memorial day weekend. she may have been consuming alcoholic beverages throughout the day. She is also very close to being considered a geriatric patient in which renal function slows down. Thanks for your reply :)

Hey Paul,
I think the gender differences in drug metabolism are really interesting. I was reading an article in the New York Times from way back in 2013. In the article, researchers were evaluating a drug that had an active ingredient that was the same as in Ambien and they found that men and women metabolize the drug very differently. Because of this, the dose for women was halved (Rabin, 2013). I have found it really interesting that prescribing is not more individualized. We all know that people metabolize alcohol differently. There is no doubt in my mind that we could be doing a much better job at individualizing drug doses. Soon, I believe that we will start using genetics, gender, and other factors to prescribe medicines more safely and effectively.

Graciana Campos,"Gender and zolpidem side effects
We are used to referencing guidance about dose adjustments based on age, weight, genetics or organ function but less so related to gender. When I reviewed LexiComp for zolpidem and considered this case for Roseanne Barr, I wondered: What causes the need to have such large differences in dosage between men and women? Are women more susceptible to side effects?
My research showed that the USDA had to revise dosing guidelines for zolpidem after it found that women were had more day-after effects related to slower clearance (Chu, 2014). I wondered if body composition differences, such as body mass and percentage body fat could be the main factors in this gender difference. I recall how body fat and body water influence the volume of distribution of a drug and therefore affect the clearance time. These issues are certainly important factors, but I found that there is also an interesting linkage between CYP metabolism and testosterone. Specifically, researchers found that testosterone may enhance CYP3A4 metabolism. This finding sheds light on men’s increasing sensitivity to zolpidem with age as well as women’s increased sensitivity across the lifespan (Olubodun, 2003).
Based on reported side effects, it appears to me that Roseanne Barr has reason to argue that her intake of zolpidem contributed to her making socially inappropriate comments. LexiComp’s listing of side effects, which include behavior change, amnesia, abnormal thinking, a decreased inhibition, certainly point to how this drug may have influenced her actions. Nonetheless, I disagree that she is not liable for her actions. We hold individuals responsible for what they have done while under the influence of alcohol and other drugs, all the while agreeing that those substances contributed to the events at hand.

Graciana,
I was surprised about how much longer zolpidem remains in systems of women as compared to men. Your article was interesting, especially the fact that testosterone might play a role in this timeline. I am also curious about differences in susceptibility to side effects between genders. The comment made by the makers of Zolpidem after the incident was also thought-provoking, stating that the drug may affect behavior, decrease inhibition, and induce amnesia, but that racism is not a side effect (Hauser). This in an important comment, because although zolpidem along with many other drugs might contribute to inappropriate behavior, these behaviors typically reflect the nature of the individual’s true feelings or beliefs, and are not usually considered excusable. Thanks for your input.

I hear what you are saying about zolpidem revealing what was likely under the surface all along, in that it decreases inhibitions, but other noted side effects are behavior change and altered thinking. I read this to mean that a person under the influence of zolpidem could truly make a break from their reality and become like another person. How can we, from the outside, truly distinguish between the two? I found the drug-manufacturers tweet about a side effect of the drug not being racism a pithy attempt to distance themselves from the responsibility of their drug inducing serious consequences in the lives of those who take it. How would they respond to a person who said they had no memory of sex with a person they would not have otherwise wanted to sleep with: being promiscuous is not a side effect of Ambien?

I agree with your assessment of liability in this case Graciana, and I appreciate how clearly you laid out your findings on the gender differences in zolpidem dosing and pharmacokinetics! I think that it's interesting that we don't treat this as simply as if someone had said they were drunk tweeting. Do you think that there is a significant difference between the behavior changes we see in alcohol intake and zolpidem use? I found an interesting article from the NIH about the long term behavioral changes people experience with chronic alcohol use, but I wasn't able to find any reliable information about long term changes with substances like zolpidem. I have a feeling in the next few years we may see more information emerging about long term use of these kinds of medications. Thank you for your post!

Thank you for your feedback. I actually revised my thinking after I made my initial post. I don't believe that drunk tweeting should be considered the same as tweeting while on Ambien. After more reflection, I realized I was making a value judgment on the legitimacy of insomnia treatment versus some other kind of medical treatment. If instead of the Ambien defense it was the Lipitor defense, I think we may react differently. Because Ambien has the pop culture popularity, plus the abuse potential that it does, I think we may not take these side effects as seriously as we would for another course of medical treatment. I'm concerned that this drug is on the market given what is documented on its side effect potential.

Sergio Rosenberg,"Ambien Defense
The first thing that came to mind when I read about Roseanne Barr’s tweet was that drunks and kids always say what they are thinking with no regards to anyone’s feelings or rational. We joke about it as adults and call it “liquid courage,” and Ambien has the same type of effect. It is considered a hypnotic and has the same effect as a benzodiazepine (LexiComp, 2018). In LexiComp (2018) one of the concerns related to the use of Ambien is abnormal thinking, behavioral changes, decreased inhibition, and bizarre behavior. However, it also stated that these changes may occur unpredictably and may indicate previously unrecognized psychiatric disorders and should be evaluated (Hauser, 2018). Dr. W. Christopher Winter of Charlottesville Neurology and Sleep Medicine believes Ambien “reveals the kinds of thoughts you are having which you are actively suppressing; Ambien allows those kinds of thoughts to be expressed” (Hauser, 2018).
Ambien has a half-life of 2.5 hours, and at 11.25 hours the drug will be 95% eliminated from the body (LexiComp, 2018). Barr made her racist comments at 2:00 in the morning, making the argument that she was tweeting while under the influence of the drug. The Ambien defense could have been used had she not had a history of having some pretty irrational thoughts and tweeting them. Barr promoted Pizzagate, tweeted that 9/11 was an inside job, and she once called Israel a “Nazi state” in 2009 (Coaston, 2018). Barr also helped to promote a Holocaust-denying musician in 2013, in the same year she also attacked Susan Rice, another Obama official, calling her “a man with big swinging ape balls” (Coaston, 2018). She can’t use Ambien defense when she’s known to have bizarre tweets.
With its half-life, Ambien, can have lingering mental effects the morning after use, and not just drowsiness. The verbal memory may slip along with mental focus, causing the individual to have a hard time concentrating (Carey, 2018). Which did not seem to be the case for Barr because she kept on tweeting and even having a tweeter feud with Chelsea Clinton. I agree with Dr. Winter that these types of drugs have a way of bringing our subconscious thoughts, whether good or bad, of coming out.

Hi Sergio,
I agree with you that even though Ambien does not change your thoughts, it could have decreased Roseanne Barr's inhibition to tweet at 0200 in the morning. In LexiComp (2018), one of the effects that can occur in loss of inhibition. Another thing about Roseanne Barr is that she is a female and according to Lexicomp (2018), Ambien exposure is greater in females and elderly with peak concentration from 45% to 75% than men receiving the same dose. Even though I do not agree with anyone insulting another human, comedians nowadays seem to think that they have a license to do exactly that. 
I do feel that regardless of her numerous other dumb insulting comments she has made in the past, her defense should still stand as we are looking at the medication itself and its side effects. I feel that Ambien could be a dangerous drug not only because of the loss of inhibition which could make you say things that are in your mind.  It can also make you do things that can have worse consequences, such as driving in the middle of the night, or cooking and eating food or having sex without you being truly awake (LexiComp 2018).  great post.

On my first analysis of this situation I, like you, associated the effects of alcohol with the effects of Ambien. As I thought about it further, I wonder if this is fair. Would I be considering it in the same way if these side effects were associated with a blood pressure medication, for example, as opposed to a medication for insomnia? If the side effects are well-documented and then experienced as part of the course of a prescribed medical regimen, perhaps that person is not culpable in the same way as a person who drank alcohol to excess.

The half-life of Ambien is 2.5 hours, and peak plasma concentration occurs after about 1.6hrs. Because of this short half-life, Ambien should have relatively few effects during the day, because after 11.25 hours, the drug should be 95% removed from the patient’s system. The medication recommendations themselves tell patients to take the medication only if they have 7-8 hours before they need to get up.
When researching Ambien, I noticed that hallucinations and behavior changes are listed as side effects, although very rare ones. It seems like if anything, Ms. Barr could blame Ambien for lowering her inhibitions and causing her to think it was acceptable to post something so horribly offensive. However, I don’t think that even a medication with side effects like Ambien could cause someone’s core belief system to change.
In addition, she mentions in her response that it was ‘Memorial Day too,’ which makes me wonder if she is referring to possible alcohol intake over the long weekend. Alcohol is known to increase the effects of Ambien, and is itself known to cause people to lose their inhibitions.

Hi Freya,
Ambien is also rapidly absorbed and has a bioavailability of 70 percent and patients should take the drug just before bedtime. the drug should also be taken in an empty stomach as food can increase the half-life which can increase the morning residual effects. The elimination is also prolonged in individuals with liver disease. I agree with you that Ambien probably caused Roseanne Barr uninhibited tweet. I also Agree with you that the medication can not change your core beliefs. That is a good point that you brought up about the alcohol or any other drugs that she might be on which could increase the effects of  Ambien.

Roseanne Bar Ambien tweet
The first question that came to mind as I read the article on Roseanne Barr’s Ambien tweet was, what are the side effects of Zolpidem (Ambien)?  Zolpidem is a non-benzodiazepine sedative-hypnotic used in the short-term management of insomnia and according to Lexicomp 2018, it specifically helps with decreasing the time it takes one to fall asleep and helps the patient stay asleep increasing total sleep time.  Zolpidem conventional tablets are rapidly absorbed in the gastrointestinal (GI) system following oral administration and have a bioavailability of 70 percent and a half-life of 2-3 hours (Whalen, K., 2015, p. 129).  The peak concentration is approximately 1.6 hours. Zolpidem undergoes first pass and is metabolized and excreted through the hepatic system via CYP450 thus, drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 isoenzyme can prolong the half-life of the drug (Lexi-Comp 2018).  Regarding Roseanne Barr, I do not know her age, what she ate prior to taking the drug, and I do not know if she drank alcohol that night.  I do not have a medical history specifically liver disease all which could influence the side effects.
In the Roseanne Barr article, On May 29, 2018, she tweeted at 02:45hrs something to the effect that the Muslim brotherhood and the planet of the apes equal Valerie Jared.  According to the article, this is the reason Roseanne Barr lost her television show. The most common side effects are headaches, dizziness, anxiety, lethargy, and GI problems such as diarrhea.  Several drug sites mention special populations regarding Zolpidem such women and the elderly.  According to Lexicomp, women and the elderly tend to have higher peak concentrations and AUC 45 percent to 75 percent higher than men with the same dose.  In 2013, the FDA recommended decreasing the maximum dose for the elderly and women.  The complex behavioral side effects of Ambien have decreased inhibition, extroversion, driving a vehicle, cooking and eating, having sex, making phone calls while not fully awake and, at times, having lost all memory of the events.
In a statement by Sonofi US, the makers of Zolpidem, they argued that even though drugs have side effects, racism is not one of them.  I tend to agree with that statement and I feel that there is no drug that can change the way you think. The fact that the drug has been known on rare occasion to cause disinhibition and extroversion I cannot dispute Rosanne Barr’s assertions that the drug led her to write the now infamous tweet, as she could have been uninhibited by the drug's effect.  It may have lessened her inhibition about writing what she thought as a comedian, however, it would not influence her actual thoughts.

Naomi, 
You make a good point about the potential factors that may have exacerbated potential side effects in Roseanne Barr’s situation. I had a similar question, particularly regarding comorbidities and liver issues, as liver dysfunction could definitely impact drug metabolism (Lexicomp). It might also be a question of whether or not she was taking any other medications or drugs at that time or if she was self-dosing, which could enhance all effects of zolpidem, because she is female and progressing in age. Roseanne as a public figure has been very controversial and is widely known for risky comments throughout her career. I agree with you that the use of zolpidem probably did play a role in decreasing inhibitions, but it could not be a justifiable cause for her natural tendency to voice controversial comments.

Anwer Hardy,"Ambien and Barr
After making her racist comments, Roseanne Barr said that she took Ambien and “I went 2 far & do not want it defended” (Hauser, 2018). My question after reading this article was did the makers of Ambien, Sanofi U.S., really address Roseanne’s claims or were they just jumping on the bandwagon and kicking Ms. Barr while she was down?
One of the known side-effects of Ambien is “decreased inhibition” (Zolpidem, 2018). This alone cannot account for the racist behaviors that Ms. Barr displayed.  However, in an article by Smith and Mendoza-Denton (2016) titled, “How to Stop the Racist in You,” the authors explain that “the new science of implicit bias suggests that the problem is not only with bad apples. Instead, prejudice is a conflict that plays out within each and every one of us” (Smith & Mendoza-Denton, 2016). They further explain, “We all carry prejudices within ourselves—and we all have the tools to keep them in check” (Smith & Mendoza-Denton, 2016). I would argue that one of those tools is inhibition. Roseanne Bar did have implicit biases that she may not have acted on if she had that inhibition. When I read her twitter statement, I do not see it as a defense, in fact, she says, “I went 2 far & do not want it defended” (Hauser, 2018). I see this is a recognition that she became racist and cannot excuse her behavior. It also is a recognition that her behavior is affected by Ambien. People have made similar recognitions in the past with recreational drugs like alcohol. For example, it is well known that some people are more likely to be verbally or physically abusive when they drink alcohol, and it is important that people recognize how their behavior can be negatively affected by a drug.
Instead of giving a short statement about how their drug does not cause racism, I think it would have been much more helpful if Sanofi U.S. had instead discussed how Ambien can decrease inhibitions and may allow implicit biases to be expressed more frequently rather than focus on their drug not getting bad press.

I think you and I have very similar thoughts in terms of Roseann Barr’s racist tweet. While the Ambien did not make her have newly developed racist and offensive thoughts, it did likely affect her cognition and inhibition to the point that she did felt no shame or hesitation to post such hurtful rhetoric. With that said, Roseanne has a signification history of offensive, racists, and outlandish social media outbursts, that she did not defend with the “Ambien defense” thus leading one to ask the question, why did she bother to even defend herself this time when she has said equally as offensive things while not disinhibited (Coaston, 2018)? I think it is interesting that you discussed the responsibility of Sanofi US to take some onus to not simply defend themselves but rather utilize this incident to address the issue of implicit bias and how Ambien can cause our prejudices and biases to become uninhibited.

Thanks for your response, Rada. I would never try to defend Barr's words or actions. I personally have never been a fan, but I do think that there was a missed opportunity for the drug company. Being uninhibited while taking a drug can have very serious social and physical consequences that could be devastating to an individual or the people that they may hurt.

I have to disagree with you about Sanofi's response. I think they wanted to separate themselves from anything to have to do with racism and Barr. Yes, the drug does decrease your inhibition, but do you believe that if Sanofi's had released a statement stating that it can lower your inhibition causing such side effects like irrational thoughts, it wouldn't look like they were trying to defend her horrible racist behavior? But Barr was attempting to use Ambien as her defense for having that racist tweet, so I think the company did what it could to distance themselves as far away from anything to have to do with racism and her.  I want to remind you that Barr helped to promote a Holocaust-denying musician in 2013, and she also attacked Susan Rice, another Obama official, calling her “a man with big swinging ape balls”  who was African American (Coaston, 2018). In the article, Dr. Winter stated how he believes Ambien can also reveal suppressive thoughts an individual is having, and it would allow those thoughts to be expressed (Hauser, 2018). I agree with Sanofi's attempting to try and not have the company associated with such hateful rhetoric.  Wasn't it Frank Outlaw that said something about watching our thoughts, because they become words, and to watch our words because they become actions?

Nobody, including Barr, said that her tweet was not racist. I do think a company can say what a drug does without defending her behavior. Alcohol manufacturers are required by law to state that driving while the drug is dangerous. That does not mean that they are defending drunk driving or saying that it is appropriate behavior. Imagine if an alcohol manufacture said something like, ""Alcohol does not cause driving accidents."" Of course, it does not cause driving accidents, but people that are intoxicated by it are much more likely to cause accidents.

In the New York Times article by Christine Hauser (2018) and in a follow up article by Benedict Carey (2018), it was noted that while Ambien (zolpidem) has a number of adverse effects that can impair cognition and memory, it would not in-fact cause one to suddenly make racists remarks when one did not have previously held racist thoughts, perceptions, or beliefs. Zolpidem, a hypnotic/sedative drug, however, does have listed as adverse effects abnormal thinking and behavior changes (Zolpidem - Lexi-Drugs, 2018). Other adverse effects, while having a risk of 1% or less than 1%, include disinhibition, cognitive dysfunction, and abnormal thinking (Zolpidem - Lexi-Drugs, 2018). Consequently, the question that comes to my mind is, could someone with good intentions and consciously held beliefs of racial equality, then express subconscious beliefs while on zolpidem? While I do not condone Roseann Barr’s comments and think she must be held responsible for her actions, the question still remains could zolpidem alter one’s cognitive functioning and disinhibition to a point that they would do something as egregious as Ms. Barr?
While the New York Times articles would argue against the “Ambien defense”, I think one should take a closer look at the pharmacokinetics of zolpidem in order to understand how such a grievous offense could have occurred. Zolpidem’s mechanism of action is primarily through the inhibition of neural action potential causing a decrease in neural excitability thus inducing sedative-like effects (Zolpidem - Lexi-Drugs, 2018). While the volume of distribution is low which would lead one to believe it would be excreted relatively quickly, it is interesting to note that the AUC is significantly increased in women compared to men due to decreased clearance rates in women. While this does not explain Ms. Barr’s racist remarks, it does elucidate the fact that the drug likely stayed in her system longer thus giving more time for adverse effects such as disinhibition to occur and wreak havoc throughout social media.
When considering the effects of zolpidem and culpability, the law article by Daley, McNiel, and Binder (2011) discusses many pertinent cases in which people blamed zolpidem on various criminal activities. However, the summary of this article notes that it is important to consider the history of the plaintiff in regards to similar activity or premeditation. In the case of Roseann Barr, two things should be considered: this was not her first outburst on social media and as the old adage goes “out of the heart the mouth speaks”. While she may be able to get away with blaming zolpidem on her disinhibition, if she had not had these thoughts before she likely would not have expressed them while cognitively impaired.

I enjoyed your discussion on Ambien. So many thoughts come to mind after reading about Ambien. It is a medication cautioned to be for short-term use only and is known to cause adverse effects such as sleep-eating as other bizarre behaviors. It seems critical, that as a provider, to carefully review harm versus benefits and to consider each patient’s individual needs when deciding to prescribe such a mediation. I had thought of drug-to-drug interactions after reading the article on Roseanne Barr’s early morning Ambien-tweet.
It is well-known that Roseanne partakes in marijuana-use. She has stated in numerous interviews that she does.  She has also stated that she suffers from mental illness in several past tweets. As a provider, how exactly would you go about when attempting to treat a complex patient such as Roseanne? First thing to consider is the importance of deciding whether Ambien is the right choice for someone like her. Ambien should not be mixed with alcohol or other drugs and this is especially important for the geriatric population. I mention geriatric because she is 65 years old.  According to Lexicomp, the half-life for Ambien is about 2.5 hours and in the elderly population that is prolonged by 32 percent” (Lexicomp, 2018). And not only that but as you mentioned, the AUC is increased in women as opposed to men.
Patient safety and patient education would be two of the most important topics to discuss with patients when prescribing Ambien to a medically complex like Roseanne. Hopefully Roseanne discussed tapering her dose or changing up a few medications with her provider shortly after her Ambien-tweeting episode.
Thank you for your post.

Rada Genovese,"RE: ""The Ambien Defense""

I think in the case of Roseann Barr there are a number of factors to consider in terms of the half-life. According to Lexicomp, the normal half-life of zolpidem is 2.5 hours (Zolpidem Lexi-Drugs, 2018). Roseann, however, is female and elderly given that she is 65 years old. According to Lexicomp, geriatric and female patients can have a significantly increased Cmax, half-life and AUC (Zolpidem Lexi-Drugs, 2018). Consequently, at the time of Ms. Barr’s 2 am tweet, her plasma concentration levels were likely higher than average given these factors. We also do not know when she took the zolpidem, thus we do not know when she may have reached a peak plasma concentration. In her rebuttal, it is mentioned that it was “Memorial Day” possibly eluding to the concomitant use of alcohol. This would be a significant contributor as well due to the fact that zolpidem is metabolized in the liver and alcohol could have also contributed to disinhibition.

Hi Rada,
I agree that Barr had to have some underlying racism or bias to have this type of response. I also wonder if she would have said the same things if she were not on Ambien. I do not know that it really matters though. For some reason, people think that prescription drugs are a better excuse than recreational drugs.  Maybe it is because they think in their minds, ""A doctor said I need this."" Regardless, I think that people should be held responsible for their actions while taking drugs, and drug companies and the medical community should be responsible for educating patients about the consequences of those drugs. Unlike alcohol, Ambien is taken by many fewer individuals and there are not the same public awareness campaigns. Also, unlike alcohol, we do not all have a friend that uses the drug and can warn us about the side effects or tell us stories about their experiences.

I think you bring up a good point about the differing cultural views of prescribed medications in comparison to recreational medication or substance use. I think we would be having a very different discussion if Ms. Barr had openly reported she'd been drunk while tweeting. I wonder if we don't still have significant cultural bias against medications like zolpidem though, I know I certainly have preconcieved notions about it. I'm not proud of stating this, but I think of rich white housewives taking Ambien almost recreationally, instead of people of all demographics who suffer from insomnia. Do articles and tweets like this further entrench stereotypical views like this?

Having read the side effects of Ambien, I wonder how people decide to take a drug with such concerning side effects? On Lexicomp, I saw numerous warnings about how it should only be taken for short-term and how it also been known to cause people to sleep-drive, prepare food, make phone calls, and binge-eat!  In the case of Roseanne Barr, apparently, it made her sleep-tweet!
It is understandable that many people suffer from problems with sleep. We are so busy in our daily lives, especially when we can obtain so much information on devices such as smart phones and tablets. Many people feel the need to multitask. People even have televisions in their bedrooms. It is not surprising that many people have trouble getting to sleeping.
However, good quality sleep is very important for our health and quality of life. Lack of sleep can be very detrimental to our health. Unhealthy sleep habits can cause chronic illnesses or diseases to worsen. I guess it is understandable that someone may feel desperate enough to take a drug like Ambien when they present with trouble sleeping and may have tried many other means to get the sleep they desperately need. It is at this point where patient education by the prescribing provider would be very important. It also would not hurt to educate the patient’s family on these side effects so that they may help in monitoring their loved one.

Rada Genovese,"RE: Ambien
Rachel,
While I agree that Ambien has many adverse side effects that one should seriously consider prior to taking, many of the side effects, especially those that could lead to amnesia and sleep-waking events such as sleep-driving or sleep-eating, are typically found in less than 5% of patients that use the medication (Zolpidem Lexi-Drugs, 2018). Ambien, however, does need to be taken in moderation if taken at all and for short periods of time. In thinking about your statements about whether one should take Ambien given the plethora of abnormal side effects, I wanted to look into other pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic options. According to UpToDate, the combination of cognitive behavioral therapy with short term (6-8 weeks) medication therapy seems to be the preferable course of action (Bonnet & Arrand, 2018). Other pharmacologic options that could be considered need to be assessed based on the type of insomnia – sleep onset or sleep maintenance. For sleep onset insomnia, medications with shorter half-lives such as the hypnotics zaleplon or zolpidem, benzodiazepines triazolam or lorazepam, or a melatonin agonist such as ramelteon can be used (Bonnet & Arrand, 2018). For sleep maintenance insomnia, UpToDate recommends longer acting medications such as zolpidem extended release, eszopiclone, temazepam, estazolam, low dose doxepin or suvorexant (Bonnet & Arrand, 2018). In your reading and research, did you find any alternative methods for the treatment of insomnia? 
I would also be curious to know if you think Roseann Barr's comments were ""caused"" by the Ambien or rather the Ambien simply disinhibited her to the point that she expressed consciously held beliefs that she typically tries to suppress?

Rachel Stafford,"RE: Ambien
Rada, thank you for that interesting information. Based on key search words, I found many non-pharmacological options for assisting in sleep. Examples I found were: relaxation, mindfulness, light stretching, reading a book, not using tablets or smart phone devices without a couple hours before bed. I understand that many of these options probably would not work for those with insomnia. It is good to know that there are many options available as far as pharmacological measures goes. As always, I think it is a good idea that patients and providers discuss these options and find the right one that would be beneficial.
In the case of Rosanne Barr and her late-night tweeting, I feel that she may have been under the influence of Ambien as well as alcohol. She has always been very outspoken and has gotten in trouble for saying things she probably should not have been saying. Ambien does not make a person racist, however, being under the influence of certain drugs or perhaps multiple drugs may cause one’s deep inhibitions come out.  I have seen it many times with people under the influence of alcohol. I hate to say it, but I think deep down inside, she has those true feelings. Those feelings just came out into a tweet. I feel the same about Mel Gibson and his drunken rant after he was pulled over by the police. He was under the influence of alcohol and I feel that he let out some thoughts he may have had deep down inside. Too much of certain drugs may cause people to voice certain deep thoughts they did not intend to share, I think. Too much drugs would not cause anyone to say racist things.

I feel like Mead’s (1970) definitions of post, pre, and configurative definitions provide a broad range of our culture in relation to age. I also find Matsumoto's 1996 definition interesting as well but it outlines that culture can be shared by a group, but can be interpreted differently by an individual. Finally I think that there could perhaps be some interesting parallels of these with Organizational Culture – Harris & DeSimone, 1994 and Cyberculture - Gunawardena, et al. (2009). When I hear cyber culture I think of primarily of interactions online, but what seems consistent between the two is certain beliefs, behaviors, and norms are used a frames of reference for basis of interaction.  While perhaps closer to the spectrum of Harris & DeSimone (1994) definition of organization culture I think of military culture. When people join the military they come from all walks of life and may have different viewpoints, attitudes and belief systems.  As soldiers train they begin to adopt, or adjust specific behaviors, and customs and norms. While reflecting on these definitions of culture it presents an interesting challenge to create a good virtual or online learning environment (OLE). Another reason we want to be mindful of culture is ]\because it can also affect the course climate of the learning environment. Reflecting back to the military it was pretty much people had to integrate and/or adapt or no longer be part of the team. In the civilian world this isn’t an option. Much like being a musician going to a show, we have to know who our audience is, and tailor our work around the audience. Building on both What Janet Smith and Valerie White mentions we generally have to adapt how we teach in OLE’s.

It is interesting to note that often times it seems that we are living in disparate cultures with conflicting ideologies or cultural actions. I know I personally touched on this in my cultural programming response, but I've seen it reflected here in this thread as well. The American ideal of individualism is at direct odds with the American Military ideals of functioning as a single unit. The collectivistic culture of many Eastern cultures is well documented in literature as being at odds with the individualistic culture that immigrants (or their children) adopt as Americans. I wonder if anyone can speak to competing cultures in other places, or if this phenomenon is unique to places that have tried to become a melting pot/soup bowl? Also, I'm unsure if this a newer construct-as we become more global and fluid-- or one that has been faced for many generations? That, I think is the one piece missing from all the definitions we looked at, the idea that competing cultures lead to truly individualized concepts of what one's culture is. I think that the beauty of e-learning is that the same material could be covered in different ways within the same time span. What if learners started an e-learning class with an assessment of their learning preferences and then had the choice to choose a path that followed that learning preference or diverged from it?

So why not create several paths through the material and allow those from different cultures or with different learning preferences to move through the class differently?

Leah Koven,"Having been an online learning designer for several different organizations, I have struggled with what Marissa Craigand Tyler Stepp have brought up regarding customizing content for learners. It's HARD to do this, at least currently, without programming a branch or path for each learner's individual circumstance. Culture can definitely play a role, but so can the individual's knowledge level, available time for learning, purpose for taking the course, and many other factors. I struggled within the Department of Energy to appropriately assess hundreds of different learners' knowledge levels and motivations for taking the course, not to mention their backgrounds and culture. DOE has employees from all over the world and some have worked there for decades and some for only a few months. I have million dollar idea, if only I knew computer programming! It would be an introductory survey at the start of an online course that could ask pertinent questions to the content and delivery, and then customize the content for the learner afterward. I know the technology exists, but in Storyline and Captivate, this would be a programming nightmare. You'd have to add so many variables, layers, and objects that I would lose my mind. I'd love to hear from everyone else about their experience with online course creation--how do you try to make a one-size-fits-all course when that's really not what learners want? How to you take into account all of the above situations and make a course that suits everyone's needs? I have found this very hard to do, without a very focused and homegeneous learner group.  ",5,3,0,0,0,7,6,2,2,0,18,0.38

Then, I have to balance of my learner's needs and their goals for the class. One thing I've done that definitely is not a perfect solution, but has gone a long way to help me understand my students, is to have them do weekly ""Key Learnings"" where they must tell me what worked, didn't work, and what they need from the material. In that way, I can create themes, identify sticky areas, and try to adapt my course materials. It is a LOT of work, much more work than my face to face classes.

Lorrie O'Malley,"Hi Marissa Craig - There are a lot of great reflections here. I think you're right that there's a real strength to e-learning in that the learner can potentially have quite a bit of autonomy in the way she or he approaches the material. I remember being struck by the reflections of the GA for a course I took with Dr. Jackson last year. While I had been considering e-learning a necessary evil and inferior to face-to-face courses, she spoke about how much more she felt she learned in online courses, where she had the opportunity to consider her responses in discussions as long as she felt she needed to, without being excluded by a live discussion that carried on without her. 
A couple things you wrote brought up some new questions for me. First, the idea of the different paths through the course rang a bit of a an alarm bell for me as an instructional designer - just thinking about the time commitment! - but also I wonder how that would impact the social cohesion in the online group?  Second, in considering your thoughts about individualized learning, I wonder if we are, in this ongoing discussion, conflating the notion of ""learning styles"" with cultural differences - should we make a distinction?

Marissa Craig,"Hi All, When I suggested various paths I wasn't thinking of completely asynchronous and totally individualized paths through the material. Rather, I was considering the idea that there could potentially be no more than 2 or 3 options for learners to choose from. One example might be that those from high context cultures might prefer a path that included video and audio conferencing, much as we have here, whereas, those from low context cultures might prefer and glean as much or more from discussion boards, and be more comfortable with that style of learning. Of course, there would be many other factors involved in which ""path"" learners choose. Potentially, these could all be separate classes as well-- the information on expectations and learning tasks would just need to be clearly described to allow learners to chose the ""best"" section. 
As to the confusion between learning styles and culture, I think there are a couple of things to consider. First, is that we if we are drawing a hard line between learning style and cultural expression/mores then we need to account for a wide variety of personality traits and varying social abilities as well. To me, while it is important to study each of these aspects individually, each alters a learner's relationship with a learning situation. Perhaps I am simply woefully uninformed and ignorant of the way learning actually works, but I'm not sure if it completely matters that if I prefer to learn alone because I believe that is my ""learning style"","" or if it is because independence and solo success was a cultural expectation or if I have social anxiety, or if all three are the case, if the combination of the way I view the world, myself and my learning helps create a barrier when approaching learning tasks.
Certainly, there is a distinction between learning styles and culture. But I think even when considering the impact of any single aspect of an experience we have to consider that a learner is still a whole person and the identified aspect is not functioning in a vacuum. Especially given the large number of people who seem to be navigating through competing cultural messages.

Cynthia Acosta,"The flow of this thread topic originated from Mead’s 1932 definition and moved on to include additional definitions of culture she has formed. Then Valerie White referenced Matsumoto’s 1996 definition.  Based off the courses I have taking for this OILs program and specifically, Dr. Gunawardena’s Cross Cultural Adult Learning, I feel that it is necessary to frame the definition of culture as relative for the subject.  Hence, for Global eLearning or Culture and Global eLearning, and review of the course description I feel the definition should have some focus to sociological culture perspectives.  I feel our definition should point to aspects as aesthetics, education levels, comfort and abilities to electronic learning or technology and what community or social organization that we want to focus on.   I can appreciate the Mead believed that human behavior is learned and that in the elearning environment we need to quickly focus the individual and group on the behavior expected to create the learning environment.  Matsumoto’s also focuses us to that group and individual behaviors.  
I might be merging the thoughts of eLearning and culture a bit in my mind or perhaps I am trying to focus this request for definitions in reverse order than they were presented.  So rather than define culture first, I want to focus on eLearning first.  (on a side note, I wonder if the flow of discussion would be focused differently if the words were listed in reverse?)
Because this assignment is to create definitions for eLearning and Culture, I offer the following:
eLearning:  The creation of an electronic environment that incorporates technology for the use of academic development.
Culture:  An accumulation of impactors that form and shape a person’s being or entity and form the social environment of the group that the person is associating with.
What I hope to gather from this tasking in module one is the framework for the course and the ability to concentrate on remainder of the course in that direction.  I believe this course should help me understand theory as related to creating and participating in an eLearning environment and be cognizant and considerate to others based on cultural impacts from each individual and the group.

Skyler Aslin,"To expand further upon the topic of identity and respect for others, I would like to comment that individualistic Western cultures feature a ""I-You"" stance, while Asia, the ""We-They"" stance is the main norm. This is illustrated by Ozkul and Aoki, who found in Japan, teachers and students prefer video conference lectures to impersonal text. In countries with a low-context environment, the use of text and independent learning may prevail. But in Asian countries, with high-context cultures, lectures and group activities seem to be more of the norm. 
To design e-learning for a global audience requires us to be cognizant of the situation of low-context versus high-context. In cyber culture, there exists a set of shared experiences which all online users can have as a result of being connected to each other through the Internet. To design e-learning for any audience requires an understanding of this type of ideoculture. From this stepping stone of cyberculture, different kinds of course material can be produced as a result. This is partially an answer to Tyler Stepp' question regarding whether a universal course can be developed. I say that it can be developed, as we are all humans sharing a connection to each other through a certain type of medium, of varying degrees of familiarity to the medium, it's capabilities, and it's limitations. One just needs to find the common ground, in this case, cyber culture, which can be observed through certain net cafes in varying places around the world, as well as in corporations that have a cubicle room filled with computers. 
To build off of Tyler Stepp' music analogy, and to summarize my post, I would like to say that western audiences feature more of a duet setup in terms of learning environments, with one person playing second fiddle to the star player of the show. Eastern audiences feature more of a orchestral setup, with the strings on one side, and the winds and percussion each taking their own space and influence in the show. E-learning is similar to learning music, because while most musicians can read sheet music, not all musicians can understand the details behind every instrument's capabilities and sounds. One needs to take on the role of a conductor in order to be an instructional designer for e-learning on a universal basis.

Nina Lockhart,"I really appreciate Tyler Stepp' music analogy and Skyler Aslin's then description of eLearning in western versus eastern cultures as instruments in an orchestra as a whole and as individual instruments. That resonates with me.
Marissa Craig brought up a great point. She said, ""We won't all learn the exact same things from this class, no matter the method of delivery."" I think this points back to outside influences/our individual culture and programming. Just as each student brings something independent to the ""learning table"" that is the classroom or in our case, the online environment, each student also walks away with different learned concepts. So it seems to me that eLearning needs to offer flexibility just as the students need to be open minded and humble. I am starting to see how interrelated culture and eLearning truly need to be in order for learning to occur online.
I see Mead's definition of culture is discussed above. But I found myself drawn to David Matsumoto's definition just as Valerie White states. I particularly like that Matsumoto acknowledges groups of people and the individual, as well as how culture is communicated through generations. Overall, defining culture seems to be very nebulous but I feel Matsumoto's definition allows room for a broad range of ideas.
To answer Tyler Stepp' question about a course developed universally: I would like to think such a course can be developed. I think a significant amount of research and cultural consideration is needed. But I do think it could be developed as like Skyler Aslin says, ""we are all humans sharing a connection to each other.."" If students in a class can keep the same goal of learning in mind, developing an universal class should be able to happen.

Frances Lopez,"Hi Janet Smith,
I like how your definition of culture addresses two aspects that I feel are important to include in our overall definition. Like you, I believe that culture is passed on amongst generations and should encompass a broad range of things that makeup a being, such as values, beliefs, rules, education, etc. I do wonder, however, how Mead's definition would change if the transmission of culture is not ""successfully learned by each generation,"" because some individuals may only adopt pieces of their culture and add on other aspects to create their subculture. When I read that piece of Mead's definition, it sounds so absolute. What do you think?

Frances Lopez,"As I read the material and the discussions above, I found that aspects of the different culture definitions stood out to me. I agree that culture is “shared by a group of people, but different for each individual (David Matsumoto, 1996);"" is “used to interpret the environment and serve as a guide for all kinds of behavior (Harris & DeSimone, 1994);” and is “used as a frame of reference for the way one looks at, attempts to understand and works with any organization (Ott, 1989).”
On top of this, I feel that culture is a fluid concept that changes throughout one’s life. It’s not static (Hoopes & Push, 1979). You may have believed one thing as you were growing up and after gaining some life experience you now disagree with that one aspect even though you still have overall the same cultural ideas. I think that’s the beauty of culture - you make it what you want it to be whether that’s individually or as a group. 
My definition of e-Learning is very similar to Gina’s mentioned above. For me e-Learning is any type of educational activity set up to enhance learner’s knowledge on a specific topic and transmitted online in any shape, form or activity that will assist the learner in reaching their learning goals, as well as those of the course. 
I’ve come to realize that e-learning is built on the culture of the instructor and designer, as well as the culture embedded within the online platform the material is delivered in. Their culture seeps into the content and is then picked up by the student who may or may not have the same culture. This can change the materials effectiveness in assisting students with thoroughly learning, understanding and acting on the content. This was a big eye opener for me. I never thought about it like this and it made me wonder how my own culture has made its way into the content I teach. This is definitely something I will be mindful of when designing training.

I've seen you make this point twice in this discussion and I'm glad you did.

One of the reasons, I think, that this is such an important point is that can be largely invisible to those who share that culture, but it can have a big impact on other students who do not.

Alma Cortez,"Frances Lopez, I also called attention to the concept of fluidity in my definition of culture, because I think that so many forces can impact how a group of individuals shifts and adapts norms, expectations, and belief structures in response to external and internal forces. I think of the impact on colonialism and also the impact of a tremendous shift in a company culture, for two examples.
The definition of culture is one I spent a lot of time thinking about as a cultural anthropology student, and like many of the students I worked with, I got increasingly frustrated with the inability of language to adequately capture all of the nuance and essential facets of the term. I think the words that I would use to define culture would be that it is a mutually constructed, defined and understood, shared set of beliefs, customs, norms, linguistic conventions, expectations, stratification, and power dynamics. It is at once perpetuated by and constructed by its members, and serves both as a memory system and a method for creating the future. It is something that has huge implications based on how much power is held collectively by a group of individuals, both because culture can be appropriated and also used as a method of erasure. It can be subject to oppression both overt and subversive.

E-learning refers to any type of training or educational activity that is mediated through technology and does not require that the learner and the instructor be in the same physical location, or indeed the same time zone, for learning and instruction to occur.

Even within cultures, of course, there are individual preferences. Designing for both - keeping both in mind - is an interesting challenge. ",3,0,0,0,0,2,0,2,1,0,34,0.72
Victoria Benavidez,"I think you did an excellent job of choosing the quote to describe culture. I also think it would be important to add something regarding influences from people and the environment. I think so much of culture is influenced by physical location that it should be included. The concept of culture comes from geography and a definition of culture wouldn't be complete without mentioning this. Also, in regard to people, they are constantly changing and interacting with each other which causes larger shifts in attitudes and beliefs.
I spent four years living in Northwest Spain and I was amazed how much the physical geography influenced everything from their food to vocabulary words. In the Galician language, there are over 70 words to describe the rain. They have words to describe everything from the strength and the frequency to the quantity to the duration. Also to be in an area that was suppressed by a dictator until 1975 has impacted the character of the people. The people are very closed and skeptical of new people. After all, they could have gone to jail for speaking a language other than Spanish where most of their native language was Galician.  
 
This concept of culture can also be taken into a corporation or an institution. Many people talk about the company culture at google which is also influenced by their physical environment and the people who run the business. 
 
In regards to creating a definition for eLearning, I think this is straight forward. The word itself gives the definition. It is learning that takes place through the medium of the internet. I don’t think that there is much that can be added or taken away to make the definition any better.
 
The complexities of this discussion are when describing how the two are related. Each person brings their individual culture into the virtual classroom and each individual contributes to the larger picture. However, we aren’t focusing on the individual but on the group. I think that it would be important to discuss culture sensitivity since we do not know the background and experiences of the people in the classroom. I think that its also important to use words like collaborative and responsive when describing how it works.

Cameron Garrity,"I, too, like Mead's definition of culture; so it is a good starting point. I am much more partial to the definition suggested by Hall and adopted in our text (page 1) - Culture is communication and communication is culture.
We have to be careful not to make our definitions of culture ahistorical, divorced from space and time. As Jaques Derrida describes in Of Grammatology, we understand a concept by drawing a line through it, by its negation. For example, we are compelled to use terms like ""American culture"" - but we have to be precise in the limitations of such a term; the culture of an Inuit family in Alaska is quite different from that of a Scandinavian-origin family of Catholics in North Dakota, though both may watch the same college football games and root for similar teams. There are shared commonalities, and great differences.
In the foreword to Madness and Civilization Michel Foucault writes that if a thing does not communicate, it dies. The same is true of all consciousness and cultures. Our text captures the foundational and mediating aspect of culture in the statement that culture is negotiated and mediated through a communication processes.

Cameron Garrity,"In this regard, I have to say I heartily disagree with the ideas that the ""west"" has an individualistic culture and other countries,such as in Asia, have a more group-oriented culture. What is problematic in this typification - first,explore the concept ""western"": it is clearly not geographical: it breaks down when we think of the geographical edges of this concept. Is the eastern extremity in Istanbul,Turkey? Is Russia ""western""? Where in Siberia does the ""west"" end? Novosibirsk? How about historically? When did the ""west"" come into existence? This origin is often co-located with ""Greek"" civilization. The Greeks were located all around the Mediterranean and many discoveries we think of as ""Greek"" were from parts influenced greatly by Turkey (in turn influenced greatly by countries father east) and African thinking; and came from Greek city-states located in Africa and Asia. Or, consider some ""western"" histories pre-dating Christianity - are the Vikings western? The Druids? It appears that commonly, in strategic terms, we think of ""western"" as the Anglo-American led alliance that includes some European states, but this alliance now includes many former ""eastern"" states. I am trying to make the point that when we try to pin the concept ""western"" down geographically, historically (what years?), it breaks down. The same holds true for ""eastern"" - take India for instance where I was born and where I lived till twenty-seven: I worked for a summer in a rain forest with indigenous forest dwellers who lived a somewhat subsistence life-style with few market interactions, and much fishing, hunting, and slash-and-burn agriculture; and another summer at the National Aeronautical Laboratories with scientists doing supersonic re-entry research using one of the world's largest supersonic wind tunnels. How do we generalize across such groups?
A statement by Heidegger comes to mind - ""We shall fail to understand the mysteriousness of being-human.... if we snatch at value-judgments of any kind."" (Heidegger, An Introduction to Metaphysics). I believe the concepts of ""western"" and ""eastern"", ""group-self"" and ""individualistic-self"" are filled with value-judgments and a search for legitimization of certain historical events such as colonization and plunder of conquered lands' resources.
With all this said, I still find it useful to engage in dialog in which these concepts and ideas (western/eastern, group/individual) are used. I just caution us all to realize their limitations and restrict the applicability of these concepts.

Lorrie O'Malley,"Hi Cameron Garrity - 
This is an interesting perspective. I do resonate with some elements of the points you're making. It's true that these notions (individualistic vs. group oriented, east vs. west) are hard to pin down and vary greatly in the way they are expressed even in a single location, across individuals of different backgrounds and classes. However, I have, myself, experienced living in cultures where it seemed that a great majority of people that I met - whether scientists or cooks, fishermen or lawyers - had the more group-oriented outlook, and this was expressed not only in the way they spoke but also in their societal institutions (the way they organized nursing homes and schools, for example). I'm speaking of my experience in Cuba that I mentioned earlier in this discussion. It almost seems to be that you are arguing against the notion of cultural differences, per se. Is that the case?

I am not arguing against cultural differences - I am saying that we should be very careful about generalizations. I heard a US sociologist at my university in India in 1978 start his talk by saying that he had only spent three months in India and so had to be careful about his ideas, and then he proceeded to make the most extreme of generalizations about Indian society (he was speaking about an individual-self and a family-self). I heard another very famous Indian economist (a far better speaker) say as a starting humorous line, ""Give me any social science theory and I can prove it wrong in India.""

It is interesting to see which type of culture definition resonates with you. Some of you have posted the difficulties in talking about culture and the stereotyping we do when we talk about it, East vs. West for example. It is also difficult when we dichotomize cultural concepts such as individualism vs. collectivism, or high-context vs. low context. I think we currently live in a world which we can consider hybrid merging several cultures. In the U.S. we have third culture kids whose heritage is a cultural mix.

Lorrie O'Malley,"Hi all - 
I'm going to re-post here an email I sent, so we can discuss it if you would like:
I have enjoyed reading this week's discussion - a lot of great insights there. As I was reading, it occurred to me that we could take the opportunity in this class to make a clear distinction between cultural differences in learners and the concept of ""learning styles"".
As many of you know, the theory of ""learning styles""  claims that different students have different modes of learning - such as auditory, visual, or kinesthetic - and that teachers should match their instruction to students' preferred learning mode to optimize learning. This is actually a myth - there is little or no scientific evidence that learning styles exist in this way or that tailoring instruction to these ""styles"" leads to greater learning. This myth is so pervasive, though, that we still hear it all the time, and it may impact our thinking. I've attached an article on this if you are interested in reading more. I know that for some, this may be a surprise.
However, it *is* true that learners differ from each other, of course. People come from different cultures, have different aptitudes, different educational backgrounds, and many other differences that teachers should take into account when they teach or train, design courses, etc. This reality factors into our discussion this week. 
I think Dr. Jackson may speak more to this later. For now, I just wanted to throw it out there and challenge us to think about this distinction as we learn together in the next few weeks.

A notable observation based on group discussion and dialog was the instructors approach to teaching in a new cultural context. Both instructors had seemingly good intentions about learning the respected cultures and customs, but still maintained difficulty in understanding some underlying cultural differences form their own. Each of these instructors took this in different ways: In “Teacher-Mark aka Mark Salzman’s” initial case he sought some compromise; in the simulation Mr. Beasley thought his students were being disrespectful.
Based on what we discussed and the videos, it is evident that both teachers did not fully participate in the immersion of the culture. Likewise, despite the fact that they relocated to these new places, they initially did not full advantage of potential immersion. While both read about these cultures and studied them habitually, that alone was not enough to get them to integrate with the culture they were interacting with. Going back to “communication is culture,  and culture is communication” there may have been more opportunities for them to examine integrate with the existing cultures.
Based on what we’ve learned so far with our projects on incorporating mLearning and India, I would suggest that this module is just as relevant as the previous one. We can read about a culture, but to try understand it, we may benefit most when we are not only immersed, but experience, and communicate with said culture. Perhaps this would be an interesting discussion topic regarding learning new cultures and experiential learning?
Given our current projects emphasis on understanding culture, I think this synthesis may feed into another aspect: there may be different cultural aspects in not only formal and informal settings, but also different communities. I think this ties into our current research on how we need to employ people within the community to make necessary changes if we wish for diffusion to occur.
Bringing this back our discussion, we need to place an emphasis on the importance of humility when interacting with cultures not familiar with our own. Not only that, we need to approach these different cultures with mindfulness. Another area we examined in Mark Salzman and Mr. Beasily’s cases was that people integrated in the community were willing to help them understand the culture.
In Mr. Salzmans case it was Teacher Hei. In Mr. Beasily’s case it was the parents and the community of the school children. In our discussion Teacher Hei actions were debated, but it was noted that she was trying to formally educate Salzman on Chinese culture in efforts for integration. In Mr. Beasily’s case it was the parents of the students that invited him to dinner.
In Rogers’ work Diffusion of innovation (1995) it’s noted that he discusses all the critical components that go into introducing new innovations to different cultures. As Rogers notes, this innovation does not have to be brand new innovation, but a new innovation to the group. When we observe and reflect on our readings about diffusion of innovation, we are trying to figure out how we as instructional designers can introduce new innovations so that they can diffuse across a new culture.
Upon introspection, I would suggest that in both Teacher Hei and the local native families case- they are the change agents for diffusion amongst us in the western world. Perhaps this is another area we should explore when trying to introduce new ideas and innovations amongst other cultures.
As part of this class, we are trying to introduce new ideas to a culture that is not always familiar with our own, and for the most part a western perspective. If we wish to try to integrate new innovations with them, perhaps we should recognize they may want to do the same with us. As defined in our discussions, our tool sets include: Communication, humility, mindfulness and open exchange to new ideas.
I want to dig in more to this topic, and I look forward to your thoughts and exchanges.
Thanks for reading!

So, I know we were supposed to wait for Maddie Williams to post but, I was getting too nervous waiting on her first post and I couldn't wait any longer... I will bite the bullet on this one...
So, for this discussion we were asked to define culture and eLearning. To me, culture is the way in which people live life based off of their upbringing, attitudes, values, beliefs, morals and traditions. Culture is something that we are born into and then throughout our life it is something that we shape into ourselves and modify to our likings. This is somewhat similar to the definition we were given in The Meaning of Culture in Online Education: Implications for Teaching, Learning and Designs “that complex whole which includes knowledge, belief, art, morals, law, custom, and any other capabilities and habits acquired by man as a member of society” (Tyler, 1871, p.1). It may be a very old definition of culture, but it one that most people (me included) can relate to and understand. To me eLearning is when a student learns in the online environment. This is usually done through various ways, such as from a computer, a phone, tablet etc. But nevertheless, they all require one thing, internet access! Now the hard question is stating how culture and eLearning are related. I could go on and say how they’re related with my opinion, but I think I’ll just stick to the readings. According to Goodfellow and Hewling, Culture and eLearning are related in many ways or culture has a way of shaping itself within the eLearning environment. For example, there was a study done that looked at three different nationalities (Korean, Finnish and American) and it looked at their cultural differences and the characterizations amongst these groups within an online learning environment. It was found that American students were more individualist when it came to being in an online course. They showed more interest in themselves and their needs. It was also found that Americans were more action-oriented when it came to finding results. Whereas students from Japan, China or Arab countries were considered collectivistic because they would put the interests of their families and community before theirs. Finns were found to be “more group focused and reflective” (Goodfellow and Hewling, p.357). While, Koreans were found to be more social when it came to online learning. So, you see our upbringings, traditions, beliefs and ways of living not only play a part in our daily lives when it comes to our wellbeing and ways of life. But they also come out when we are learning. Whether we are learning in a classroom or in an online environment our culture plays a huge role. So, this pretty much explains why some people “don’t play well with others”, because they probably didn’t get much interaction with people at home or in their community. This also explains why some people are great with working with groups or even with a certain age range of people (they are around them more, they are taught to respect those kinds of people and they were taught how to work well with others and they probably have good experiences with doing so). I think the best example I have to share with you all about culture having/playing a role in the online/face-to-face learning environment would be last semester I worked with a small group of people and one of my group members was very religious. Because she was respective of her religion she was unable to do certain things on certain days throughout the week or touch technology etc. on certain days. For example, she was a full-time student and part time worker, but she was not allowed to touch, talk, work or do anything related to school or work on Sundays. She was to go to church from 6am to noon and then back home to prey, clean and get ready for the week. So, for our class projects we had to try and get everything done early in the week. Including talking to her because she was not able to use her phone or computer on that day either. Neat huh?",11,0,0,0,0,21,8,4,0,2,0,0.00
Annie Mederios ,"RE: Respond to Maddie Williams's initial post!
My definition of culture is the values, norms, beliefs (religious), and familial interactions and behavioral edicts that shaped me into the person I am today. In reflecting on my upbringing, my father was a strong disciplinarian and kept my sister and I in line so to speak. There were acceptable behaviors and non-acceptable behaviors and consequences and rewards for both. There were also strong familial interactions with my aunts and uncles whom I spent a lot of time with growing up. The time spent with them reinforced the way I was being taught at home. Since I was the youngest in my family, there was a lot expected of me as opposed to my sister. As I look back now, i'm guessing the reason for this was maybe my parents felt they could have made different decisions where my sister was concerned and therefore didn't want to make those same decisions with me.
As far as elearning goes, there is the obvious definition of distance learning/education via a computer with an internet connection but I believe it goes further than that in that there needs to be an attempt to engage the learner through activities, discussions, interactions etc. Until now, I had not thought of culture as having an affect on distance eduction and eLearning. Most of the distance education courses I have taken focus on the standard norms such as discussions based off of rubrics and my weekly participation. Both were things that were very important parts of my grade. I don't feel that I really was being held to any specific learning other than meeting the basic requirements of the rubric. I ask myself now, how much learning really occurred? I can understand better after completing the readings how culture can influence learning and probably affected how I learned in previous courses. American culture in general seems to focus on the immediate here and now learning and getting things done quickly, working towards the rubric or assignment requirements and doing exactly what needs to be done to complete the course and hopefully get an A. I've taken courses online that at times have made me feel that I'm merely going through the motions to meet course requirements rather than gaining any additional knowledge. 
I agree with Taylor Vaio that Americans are definitely more individualistic. I think this applies in school but also in work environments. In my experience, culture in learning in school or work favors individuals as opposed to groups. Collaboration is attempted but never really accomplished. After completing our readings, I am starting to have a better understanding about the reasons for individualistic focuses on distance ed and am eager to learn more about how to overcome this and move towards more collaborative learning and teaching methods going forward.

Hi Annie Mederios,
I want to quote your reflection on the American culture that you inherited and how you bring that to your online learning.You mentioned that "" American culture in general seems to focus on the immediate here and now learning and getting things done quickly, working towards the rubric or assignment requirements and doing exactly what needs to be done to complete the course and hopefully get an A. I've taken courses online that at times have made me feel that I'm merely going through the motions to meet course requirements rather than gaining any additional knowledge."" I really like how you actually reflected your e-Learning experience from your own culture. Being a foreign national myself (Chinese) and having been in the U.S. for 12 years, I hardly heard any Americans reflect on their own cultures and how that could influence their learnings and their relationships with others. I think for one, we are in the U.S., so as an American people don't generally think about how their own culture can affect other cultures. I suppose if an American goes to Europe or Asia, or any other countries, they may start comparing their own culture with others' culture and gain lots of insights on the relationships between culture and all other aspects of life. 
I want to reflect on how my own culture has affected my learning in general. I grew up in China until I was 16, and in Chinese culture we do focus a lot on taking the time to reach your own goals. Now, China nowadays has become more and more like the Western cultures, where people pursue immediate results and accomplishments without putting a lot of time and energy into their work. However, when I grew up in China in the 90s and 2000s, my education and the teaching I received from my parents were to really focus on building solid foundations for whatever I did. After I came to the U.S. and started college, one thing that I noticed I had that was very different from domestic students was that I put a lot of time reading textbooks. It was almost like an OCD that I had to read my textbooks or do all of the assigned readings before I make an argument or write a paper. I hardly saw that in American students, and I believe that the ""freedom of speech and doing everything"" aspect in American culture really encouraged domestic students to quickly voice their judgments and opinions without having a lot of background information. There is truly no right or wrong. I see advantages and disadvantages in both choices. 
Thank you for bringing up a good point that in turn made me reflect on how my culture affected my learning.

Hi Jvonne Gomez,
Thank you for sharing some of your culture and background with me. Chinese culture has always intrigued me and I'm a bit disappointed to find out the culture has leaned more towards our Western culture. I hate to admit that in some cases I've experienced and relied upon my American culture to help me complete a course. I am always hopeful that American culture will keep evolving. I feel over the last twenty years or so, there has been an emphasis on learning quickly, getting the degree and getting a good job. Thus the many instances of completely online universities offering more on line college courses or the ability to complete a degree in 2 years rather than 4 years etc. My feeling is this societal expectation that we move quickly through school, lives, work etc. has contributed to less learning taking place. I may be wrong and freely admit this is my personal opinion based on observations, but I'm wondering when and where we started moving away from valuing the effort and commitment it takes to even attend college, obtain a degree, thoughtfully find a job that fits in with the type of degree obtained and work towards an end goal. Anyway, thank you for expressing your observations and feelings about my post and American culture. I appreciate it.

Hi Annie Mederios and Jvonne Gomez, 
I wanted to jump in because I find this perspective on culture fascinating. Americans can indeed be culture centric. Many of us do not realize the influence of American culture on our daily lives until we are placed in a culture that operates differently. When I volunteered and lived in South America for a year, I found that one of the most common phrases I used when talking to my local friends in the first few months was ""In mi cultura..."" and then I would explain what was causing me culture stress. Without realizing it, I was trying to operate off of American culture norms and I expected my Colombian friends to do the same. By explaining ""in my culture, we do ______"", I expected them to understand why the way that we did things was normal. Eventually, I began to see that their eyes would glaze over and that I wasn't going to change the way they managed their time or approached higher education. They had other priorities and I eventually saw the difference in culture as a beautiful thing! I like the term, ""culture stress"" because I think that this captures living in a foreign culture much better than culture shock. There are some things from your home culture that you never let go of (i.e. reading textbooks, Jvonne Gomez!) and there are some things that you adapt to. Trying to overcome the standard operating procedure you have grown up with to fit in with the norms around you is stressful! The important part is to go in with an open mind. Know where you are coming from and respect where someone else is at. It took me almost the full year to realize this but I feel thankful for the opportunity to see that the American Way is not the only way to live life!

Caroline Sanchez, thanks for sharing such a great experience with us. I personally have never ventured outside of the United States. Not for lack of desire, more lack of opportunity than anything. I find other cultures fascinating and always wonder what must other countries think of Americans? Did you find that South American culture was less driven? What I mean by that is it seems like we as Americans are always expecting more from ourselves and each other where in other countries, my assumption is there may be ambition but it's acceptable to not be as worried about drive and there are different goals that motivate the culture. Is that correct? I'm curious what you thought were similarities and differences between American and South American culture?

Hi Annie Mederios,
I was the eldest in my family and feel like my parents, as well as other family members, expected a lot out of me because I was the oldest of five. I had more rules, discipline, and responsibility to be a good example for the others and all of my mistakes were broadcasted throughout my family to make sure I did not make them again. I think it is interesting that my parents thought I should be perfect, but were much less strict with the younger children. I always felt that they must have seen or realized the pressure was just too much to put on me, so they were lenient with the others. I never thought about how it would be for the youngest child in a family. My baby sister was, and remains, the free spirit in the family who has not quite figured it all out yet, but I wonder if she felt pressure as a child to be perfect or not do all the dumb things we did.

Culture is a constantly evolving and live concept. I agree with many of the definitions in the powerpoint presentation. I especially like the adaptation from Gary Alan Fine, which states that it is “shared by members of an interacting group”. I believe an established or inherited culture remains active and passed on because it is practiced, cherished and built upon by each individual. Harris & DeSimone called it a “set of shared values, beliefs, norms, and artifacts” and Matsumoto also referred to culture as a “set of attitudes”. I think they are both right. I personally share a different set of attitudes as work then I do at home or church. The values and beliefs remain the same for me, but they are practiced very differently in each culture in which I participate. I appreciate that artifacts were also mentioned because I do believe some cultures are derived from this concept. For example, my beliefs and values are derived from the lessons of the bible, though I believe it to be a telling of true events, it is still considered an artifact of my faith and my culture of living. Similar artifacts of culture could be cellphones and the culture they have created for social media or perhaps how coffee or wine and the different culture settings they create. A person can participate in many different cultures, while still maintaining a consistent set of attitudes of their own culture. Culture itself is complex and impossible to define.",4,2,0,0,0,22,3,6,1,1,7,0.10

Hi Kate Charles,
I absolutely agree with you that ""culture is a constantly evolving and living concept"". This really made me rethink about the definition of culture vs. ""my culture"". Are we talking about cultures based on what we grew up with, or what we became later on? I know that there are certainly links between these two, but as I grew up and started experiencing different aspects of life and the world, I have definitely developed a culture that belongs to me and no others. I think I will elaborate on this point further in my post below (not in the replies, but in my own writings at the end).

You shine light on complexities of culture with such clarity. Great observation on we can share differing attitudes in various settings like with family, friends, co-workers, spiritual/religious settings. The concept of beliefs and values being consistent but practiced differently according to our setting, offers me a sense of peace in our multi-faceted, fast paced society.
In our informational based culture, artifacts like cellphones, the type, version and features suggest the high degree we can discriminate to determine and evaluate cultural norms.

Culture
To me, I see two essential parts of culture. On a macro scale, I agree with Margaret Mead's (1932) definition, that culture is ""the whole complex of traditional behavior which has been developed by the human race and is successively learned by each generation"". On a micro scale, as many have mentioned here in the forum, culture also includes a person's unique intake, involvements, and developments from what that person grew up with from the past generations. This would in turn evolve into a ""one's culture"", not just ""culture"". 
As an example, since I grew up in China until I was 16, I do see lots of Chinese values in me no matter how old I get. Modesty, hatred toward pride, respect to the elders, feeling unsure about my own opinions until a superior power affirms my values, and even dressing modestly. That's part of the ""culture"" that I experience and inherit. In addition to that, coming to the U.S. at an early age and becoming a first-generation Christian in my family, I have certainly developed ""my own culture"". This part makes me entirely unique from the others, even from those who grew up similarly as I did. Now I journal and dream in a mixture of English and Mandarin languages. The free spirit I gained after being in the U.S. for a long time offered me a fresh and bold new take in understanding the Bible and building churches. The part that I inherited from my traditional Chinese culture has integrated with my own experiences surviving in a new country and choose a spiritual pursuit that can be totally misunderstood by people around me.

E-Learning 
E-learning is a way of learning and teaching that includes learners learn through interactions with the contents and the whole learning community through the Internet. I want to emphasize on the fact that e-Learning focuses on the ""distance"" aspect, that the main communications and interactions among people and learning contents are online. A hybrid learning environment includes both F2F and learning through the Internet, however, it is not the involvement of the Internet that could quality a learning as ""e-Learning"". Rather, it is the involvements of the Internet plus a distinct Internet communication and interaction that completes the definition of e-Learning. ",1,3,0,1,0,9,4,5,2,2,12,0.16

Hello classmates,
In my opinion, culture is defined as one’s relationships, values, attitudes, traditions, and behaviors. Culture can be considered complex since it consists of social groups who share the same knowledge, belief, morals, and customs. Another way to view culture is by set patterns, feelings, and ways of thinking. Our classmate, Taylor Vaio, made an excellent point regarding how people are born into the culture. For example, since I am taller than the average height, I was instantly placed in the “tall person” culture which consists of the question, “Do you play basketball?”.
Electronic learning (eLearning) can occur in a traditional setting or via the Internet in an online setting. In the traditional classroom setting, eLearning would consist of a PowerPoint presentation or video/films. Online eLearning is considered as a web-based course comprised of discussions, videos, quizzes offered an online platform such as Moodle or Blackboard. One area that culture and eLearning have in common is the fact that both are constantly changing. Personally, when I think of eLearning and culture, I think of introversion and extraversion. I am curious on whether people who tend to be more introvert find themselves in online programs instead of traditional programs. Of course, there are other reasons why people choose online versus traditional learning, but from a related cultural perspective, introversion/extraversion and eLearning are a prime example.

Online courses have always been more difficult for me to get into and enjoy.

In many ways it is lovely the internet is allowing us to create these subcultures that can increase individual feelings of belonging...of course, it can be used poorly as well.

Hi Logan Raider, and thanks Laura Lucero and Giuliana Davis for interjecting your perspectives. 
I think a lot of this depends on how you define introversion, and also understanding that although someone may be introverted or extroverted, we can all be ""trained"" or socially programmed into the opposite of what we naturally are. I think that American culture rewards extroversion over introversion; Americans tend to be offended if someone doesn't smile or say hello, where as if you do that in even other western countries like Russia or the Maddie Williamsce, you're frowned upon. I think other cultures view extroversion as offensive or intrusive, and reward more humble presentation of self, or deference to elders, as Jvonne Gomez mentioned she experienced growing up in China. (Jvonne Gomez, I hope I'm capturing that accurately!)
I learned one definition of introversion that really resonated with me. It's understood that introverts ""recharge"" when they are alone, while extroverts actually gain energy by being with other people. 
Many people would describe me as an extrovert. I do well in group settings, I can be called upon to present to large groups without much notice and be fine, and I enjoy meeting new people. However, if I don't get some time to myself, my entire being suffers. I can't recalibrate and recharge. I know that my Italian-American heritage very much expects one to be extroverted, and it was something my family encouraged growing up. It was only in my late 20s that I realized that although I enjoy people, I really do need time alone to feel balanced and re-energized. 
Laura Lucero, although I am an introvert, this is my first online class. So far, I've enjoyed the way that Lani and Bri Ramirez have setup the course, but it's certainly outside of my comfort zone! I actually think that the amount of time and attention that you have to spend online reading the discussion boards, which are about pretty intimate topics, takes more energy for me to accomplish than finishing the readings and assignments outside of class, and attending a seminar like discussion during class and engaging the professor and classmates. 
I wonder if anyone else has thoughts on this. Thanks again for sharing! ",0,2,2,0,0,11,6,9,1,2,16,0.22
Maddie Williams MANAGER,"Maddie Williams's definition of culture and eLearning
I believe that people's belief, used as artifacts, are the way we communicate with our families. From one generation to the other is what defines culture. I believe culture defines our worldview that sets boundaries between them. However, the concept of culture means different things to different people. Some people use a mental map that guides their relations to their surroundings and other people. Culture, when shared by a large number of people produce a spiritual, material or non-material aspect of human life that gives people a sense of direction and differentiates them from other groups and societies. I believe culture is learned not inherited. 
Culture, to me, influences the beliefs and values of designing and interacting in eLearning. I believe the design of the value system has influenced the lessons we have learned in growing up. I uphold my value systems, and they influence the way I communicate with others and the way I learn. Once I became aware of my cultural makeup, it was easier to understand cultural differences. I further understand the differences from my own life experiences. 
A person's characteristics, motivation, do they find the content interesting, and their attitude towards the learning. One's definition of culture determines how culture will play a role in how they will adapt to eLearning. The following quote captured the essence of culture for me. 
""Culture flashes on the goodness that acknowledges. practices, and passes from one to later generations. (Nienghatai Kopholklang, 2545).

Rachel Brown,"RE: Maddie Williams's definition of culture and eLearning

Culture
To me culture, in the context of human beings, is how a person associates and identifies him/herself with other similar people. Association can be in the form of things such as the foods you eat, or ways of conducting oneself such as wiping your rear end with toilet paper (kind of a wasteful, expensive, and silly idea when you analyze it). Culture also contains non-material elements such as values, societal belief patterns, which lead to policies form civilizations. For example, in many parts of the United States you cannot buy alcohol at 10am on Sunday. Why is that? Logic would state that is because it is the law. Probably though, that law was influenced by the dominate Protestant Christian society in positions of power that decided that people should be in Churches on Sunday morning. 
Something new I learned from the readings about culture was Hofstede’s five dimensions of culture (Edunson, Andrea (2006). I haven’t seen some of these categories displayed as bipolar scales. I question if these categories are still relevant in the form of a scale now that understandings of topics like gender continue to mutate away from a normative binary. 

Elearning
To me, Elearning is a buzzword from the 90s when companies realized they can train people through computers. This week’s readings about online learning seemed like academics are trying to be able to quarantine the concept and study it. Yet, I think the average day user of technology, such as the internet, just considers online life as part of normal life. This is the way our civilization acquires information now. Perhaps, if we study online learning as an evolution of communication and culture, we might find different insights then trying to bucket it into a specific topic. 
As to Maddie Williams's question, ""would developing eLearning and teaching models which match to the user's perception promote acceptance to eLearning in different cultures?""
Many large tech companies, in particular social media companies such as Facebook, are very concerned with this idea that learning online be too catered to one's perception or vision of the world. There is a fear of people will create reinforce their biases and believes and potentially leading to a more fragmented and divided society. Yet, the irony of it all is how these companies find themselves in a rock and a hard place because they only survive by user engagement. User engagement tends to be highest when algorithms present articles that the user loves or hates. I think it will be important for us as instructors to facilitate spaces where people can constructively participate in discourse. ",3,1,1,0,0,11,4,5,1,1,18,0.25

It is interesting to me that we are talking about finding the meaning of culture in at least three areas - (1) being a part of a culture, (2) creating cultures (3) navigating cultures different than our own. 

Rachel Brown mentioned from our reading Hofstede’s Five Dimensions of Culture (Edunson, Andrea, 2006). After reading his post I went online to read more about the dimensions (now six dimensions). 
I read an article putting the dimensions into context (ironic given that we have talked about culture and context). Link to article here: https://scholarworks.gvsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1014&context=orpc

What particularly struck me was the Power Distance Index (PDI), which refers to the power differential in a culture. At the above link go to page 9 at the bottom and the table gives examples of power differences.
On Wikipedia it discusses the scores that countries were given using this scale and the United States scored basically in the middle, where Guatemala scored high, and Isreal scored low.
Link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hofstede%27s_cultural_dimensions_theory

Cindy Maez shared how culture can have a positive or negative impact on society. Given the scoring mechanism I can see how culture, values, etc. can lead to that interpretation given the scoring of power, masculinity, etc. It reminds me of how in some places where I train respect is given with a firm handshake and looking someone in the eye directly, whereas in other places that can be perceived as incredibly disrespectful. Like in the video regarding Navajo Nation, if we only look at culture through our lens (and draw meaning on behaviors based on our perceptions), we may be interpreting great cultural strengths as weaknesses. For instance, the way western culture views traditional healing, etc. as alternative (not recognized, or billable as a service).

Maddie Williams posed the question ‘would developing eLearning and teaching models which match to the user's perception promote acceptance to eLearning in different cultures?’
It seems to me that in order to address cultural differences you must learn as much from the participants as they are expecting to learn in the learning environment. From a previous course we learned that adult learners increase competence when attaching new concepts to previous knowledge/experiences. This can be done by using common knowledge, or imagery, that participants can identify with and add competence to. But what is common to one, may not be to another. For instance, in Hawaii when I work with native communities it is common to use the ocean and waves as an example to apply learning to. Outside of that community/culture it may not be as affective.

There have been so many good definitions of culture thus far – I’d just like to add that I think of culture as the intersections of beliefs, values, experiences, age, food, traditions, ceremonies, etc. The intersections can be incredibly varied, and change throughout time. When we take our intersections of culture and apply them on top of another, it not only increases misunderstanding but also we miss out on expanding our own world view and opportunity to learn. 
I believe it is critical to practice empathy in an eLearning environment, as Brene Brown says, to honor that my humanity is connected to yours. We can disagree, and be respectful, and learn, etc.",2,2,1,1,1,27,7,8,2,3,19,0.26

Hi Mallory Fetterolf,
I found so much in your post, I don't even know where to begin. First, thanks for your thoughts, it was definitely enlightening. I think what I like most was when you talked about "" using common knowledge, or imagery, that participants can identify with and add competence to"". Not only is the advice great about using familiar imagery for the participants, but that it be something they can add competence to. This is such and important idea because often there are lots of pictures and graphics, but they are not always relevant or functional. Adding media that will have significant meaning or purpose is a great way to support a culture and encourage learning. Great post!",1,1,0,0,0,10,4,2,0,0,20,0.27

Rachel Brown, you raise an interesting response to Maddie Williams's question. What's interesting to me about this is that companies and larger societal engines fear this negative feedback loop where we as community members are ever more engrossed in the same forms of media, news, etc. and therefore more entrenched in our own ways of thinking over time (leading to a more fragmented, closed minded society), but these companies themselves cater to that fragmentation by tracking our data and advertising to us based on our searches of media, news, etc!

I really appreciate your logical response to Maddie Williams's question. It is so interesting that social medias both encourage and fear users' unique perceptions. That actually allowed me to compare the Chinese government vs. the U.S. government. The former fears citizens' unique opinions and biases because they are terrified with not being able to manage such a huge country. The latter encourages uniqueness and individualities to such an extent that nobody knows what's right any more, or at least what is truthful. This is such a hard balance to create.

Jacob Cannon,"RE: Maddie Williams's definition of culture and eLearning
To me culture is the set of ideas, behaviors, attitudes, and traditions that exist within large groups of people (usually of a common religion, family, or something similar). These ideas, behaviors, traditions, etc. are passed on from one generation to the next and are typically resistant to change over time. Cultures vary widely not only across the world, but even right next door. 
To me e-learning came about in the 80's around the time the internet was created and is a learning system based on classical teaching but with the help of electronic resources. While teaching can be based in or out of the classroom, I think the use of computers and the Internet forms the major elements of E-learning. I also think that e-learning can also be termed as a the transfer of skills and knowledge, and the delivery of education is made to a large number of recipients at the same or different times. 
In response to Maddie Williams's question, ""would developing eLearning and teaching models which match to the user's perception promote acceptance to eLearning in different cultures?"" I think it would; and I may be way off the mark here, but just as different American companies have opened businesses around the world but they have adapted and tweaked their services to be culturally accepted in various parts of the world. So that said, I think that eLearning can do the same as long as the cultural norms are respected.

Caroline Sanchez","RE: Maddie Williams's definition of culture and eLearning
To carry on the great conversation started by Taylor Vaio and Annie Mederios, I want to tie in my perspective on eLearning culture. Have you noticed the slightly different culture that forms in each OILS course that you have taken within the online discussion groups? Much of this culture comes from set norms by the students and expectations communicated by the Instructor. Even in an environment where we only know each other by voice and written word, we still tend to form a culture that mirrors our values. I am interested to hear your take on how you have seen various eLearning culture shifts in your different OILS courses. What was the driving factor for the difference?
Culture
In a strange comparison, defining culture reminds me of how you would explain the reason you've chosen the haircut you wear today. Almost everyone has a different hair cut or hairstyle that has been acquired through socialization and personal choice. It can reflect customs, conformity, or artistic expression. In the same way, Culture is a set of religious, artistic, environmental, or habitual values you have adapted through your lifespan. Although it is part of who you are today, it can be changed throughout your lifetime to match the way you perceive you fit in in the world. Culture is an attempt to satisfy our need to know where we belong among the people around us. Culture shock comes when we realize that we do not fit in with the norms around us. We either much hold on the our contradicting habits and accept culture stress, conform, or attempt to influence those around us. I enjoyed the simplicity in Sir Edward Tylor's definition of culture; "" the complex whole which includes knowledge, belief, art, morals, law, customs, and any other capabilities and habits acquired by man as a member of society."" (Tylor, 1871, pg. 1) Culture is acquired and is very much a social construct influenced by co located people. As my husband and I consider moving to the foreign culture of the Pacific Northwest, I have spent much time thinking about how we will adjust. 
eLearning
I have thought quite extensively about eLearning as this was the topic of my Capstone Internship. eLearning is better defined as distance education. Even though eLearning is still a very popular buzz word, it is just another medium for teaching information electronically across any distance. eLearning has the benefit that it is electronically communicated and can therefore be replicated or manipulated to best fit the needs of the learners it aims to teach. Since the environment does not make interpersonal communication as natural as a face-to-face course, the culture of the course needs to be set upfront with respect as a mandatory expectation and an openness to cultural differences.

HI Caroline Sanchez,
I appreciate your exploration of distance learning. I especially like your statement that eLearning ""can therefore be replicated or manipulated to best fit the needs of the learners it aims to teach"". I find a lot of inspiration and creativity can be expressed through distance learning. However, based on some of my experiences, I would have to disagree that eLearning ""does not make interpersonal communication as natural as a face-to-face course"".  A few semesters ago, I took a course on virtual learning environments. In that course, we were assigned an avatar and met in a virtual learning space. The space was fully customizable and felt completely interactive. After the first couple of sessions, I noticed that we (our avatars) treated each other as we would in a traditional classroom. If our avatars would accidentally bump, we'd apologize to each other as if we'd actually bumped our neighbor. Our avatars walked in small groups, some alone, as you would expect in real life. We were even able to have individual study sessions while sitting at the beach or by a firepit. It was a very unique and extremely personal experience. We formed relationships with each other even though we were still all sitting in front of our computers. While there are limitations to eLearning, there are also many avenues to create culture and interpersonal communication. Great post.",1,0,0,1,0,5,5,2,1,0,25,0.34

Hi Caroline Sanchez and Kate Charles,
Thank you so much for sharing your thoughts on this! Although this is my first online class, and therefore I guess you could argue my first formal eLearning experience, I do run some online forums for Project ECHO's partners. I've noticed that while some people are more comfortable speaking in person or on the phone, many are much more comfortable emailing. Similarly, I would say that the online platform allows others that are not as comfortable speaking in person to interact more if it's online. I know many colleagues and friends who suffer from social anxiety, and who bristle at the thought of being called on in class or put on the spot in meetings. Although this is something I am accustomed to (perhaps from the American culture I've been reared in?  ), I wonder if this online communication is more natural for others. Perhaps online learning and forums have changed the way we communicate so much so that they now have a firm place in American culture. What do you all think?

 Annie Mederios ,"RE: Maddie Williams's definition of culture and eLearning
Caroline Sanchez,
You make a great point about how culture really can be a matter of what or who we identify with. In my childhood, while i came from a two parent household, I spent a lot of time with relatives because my dad was working and my mother traveled during the summer when she was not teaching school. I had a lot of responsibilities as a young child when I had to travel on my own to stay with relatives for the summer. This experience made me different from others. I could not fit in with others accounts of their summers and spending it with their parents and siblings. I felt really weird about this as a child. As an adult, I've come to realize this experience helped me learn how to be independent. Today, my independence is extremely important to me both at home and at work. Societal norms don't always appreciate or consider traits and habits we learn. Culture in my experience is often in conflict with outside influence and expectations. My own experiences of being independent at such a young age (9 years old), supports my current learning style preferences, (self-motivated distance education courses). Maybe I am way off on this topic but the discussion so far has certainly made me think and wonder why I approach learning a certain way and what really drives me and my learning preferences? Are these questions asked by instructional designers everywhere?

Hi Annie Mederios, 
I think that every Instructional Designer comes to a point where they have to question how their personal culture influences the way they prefer to learn and even the way they choose to design courses. Designers also learn to ask the same question about their target audience. What drives my learners and how would they best absorb this information based on their learning preference? 
It is great that the discussion has made you stop to think about why you feel the way you do about certain learning climates. I constantly have to keep myself in check when designing user experiences. I want to create it the way that I would enjoy learning it. Awareness of my norms and societal norms is a good starting place. It is hard to not be biased in what you think the learner needs!

 Linda Miller ,"RE: Maddie Williams's definition of culture and eLearning
Linda Miller’s Definition: Culture is the mindset, beliefs, and values held by a group of people.  Language is an important part of culture as it is how the group communicates.  Culture can be geographic made up of people with shared history.  It may also be cultivated within a community, such as an organization working together for a shared goal or a group of people from different locations coming together over shared interests (think Comic-Con).
Maddie Williams-I wholeheartedly agree that culture is learned and not inherited.  As you said, culture is passed from one generation to another.  If children are taught tolerance and acceptance of differences, they will then teach their children to be tolerant and accepting.


Linda Miller’s Definition: e-Learning is technology assisted learning.  It is often referred to as online or distance learning.  e-Learning has expanded rapidly in recent years as it is convenient for non-traditional students or those who are far away from the institution from which they wish to learn.  This type of learning generally requires the student to be more self-motivated.
Rachel Brown and Jacob Cannon-You both reference the rise of e-learning during the 80s/90s with the availability of computers and the internet. As Rachel Brown mentioned, these things are now so commonplace that they are part of ""normal life.""  Googling has become a verb to look something up on the internet.  We essentially have access to everything we could ever want to know at the touch of our fingertips.  I like Jacob Cannon’s utility of e-learning that it allows, ""delivery of education"" (technology) ""to a large number of recipients at the same or different times"" (convenience and availability).



Maddie Williams’s Question: ""Would developing eLearning and teaching models which match to the user's perception promote acceptance to eLearning in different cultures?""



Linda Miller's Answer:  In short, yes, but its complicated.  I think that matching teaching models/styles and technology (e-learning) to cultures would promote acceptance of these as effective learning tools.  However, think of the time, effort, and money that would go into personalizing education.  The reality of it is so much more complex than the idea.



This question reminded me of personalized medicine.  The idea that doctors can tailor drugs and treatments to an individual based on their genomic code is both exciting and scary.  Could we do the same with education?  I have concerns that the more we see ourselves as different, the less accepting we will become of others differences.  I agree with Rachel Brown’s comment that catering to “one’s perception or vision of the world” may “reinforce their biases” and lead to a “more fragmented and divided society,” rather than the learning community one would hope it would become.

I appreciate your caution regarding the investment of time, effort and money.  Access to reliable communication/informational technology around the world is a challenge.  If future instructors/trainers reflect on cultural aspects of their audiences, and adapt their content accordingly, we can make enormous gains in promoting knowledge while sustaining cultural treasures. 
 
This philosophical approach to culture, I believe should not be limited to eLearning, but hopefully incorporated into wider teaching, employment, humanitarian and global practices.

I agree with Maddie Williams that culture is learned, but I also do believe that it can be inherited as well. Maybe not genetically passed down through generation but I do agree that it is learned and also inherited. Culture to me is dependent on the individuals willingness to acquire as quoted by Edmundson (2007) ""knowledge, belief, art, morals, law, custom, and any other capabilities and habits as a member of society"". Of course I do believe that members of society may different in other countries to each race, ethnicity, etc. It's dependent on the individuals beliefs. 
Elearning is the ability for all types of society members to come together and learn. It's the ability to test boundaries and grow out of our comfort zones. Here again Edmundson (2007) quotes principles of Elearning students as looking at it as an adventure, and adapting to a new environment, along with open mindedness to try new things, as well as joining study groups and social groups. Looking at Elearning as a virtual community of culture can help individuals looking to participate in such an environment. 
To answer Maddie Williams's question, I do believe that models unique to different cultural perspective would encourage a greater acceptance amongst different cultures to eLearning, however, I believe that the challenge that comes with the different perspectives in an eLearning course would be taken away if teaching models were created for unique cultures. It's the mix of various cultures being able to come together in an eLearning environment that makes eLearning much more acquiring of new information for those looking to seek it.

I wasn't sure where to respond and then realized the very first post said to respond to Maddie Williams's initial post. So here it is...
Rachel Brown said culture is how we identify ourselves. Maddie Williams said it gives us a sense of direction. Debi Duran explained culture as exposure that shapes the way we think. All of those are correct. I took a course on Wisdom in Spring this year and we had to define wisdom. Those qualities mentioned above defining culture are paramount to defining wisdom as well. The difference though is that some cultures can be toxic or unhealthy. For example; the drug culture. Whereas wisdom is looked at as beneficial for the greater good in some way. So I would like to add that culture can have a positive or negative impact on society.  
Tamera said something interesting, “that culture can be inherited, not genetically passed down but inherited.” I think that there is more that is genetically passed down than we give credit. If a family has a predisposition to anxiety, bipolar, albinism, cleft palate, intellectual disability to name a few; all those genetic factors can play a huge role in your culture. I think we can all agree that our life experiences do lead to a set of cultural beliefs. I would be interested to read more on adoptions studies and genetic influence on culture. I would argue that you can pass culture down genetically in some way. Unlike my argument that Culture is a genetic trait somehow.  Cultural DNA posits that the culmination of one’s life is their culture, but just as unique each individual is, so is their culture (Gunawardena, Frechette & Layne, 2019).
I think that ELearning is modern learning. Most industrialized cultures are highly dependent on electronic use. I see the world through American lenses and do not know enough of what is going outside of our borders but education in this country is heading toward an E based learning system. Recently I went to research at a local library and was told that I should look online.
My answer to Maddie Williams’s question is simply, yes. If you market to a consumer, such as Rachel Brown mentioned, they will be more interested. It is an interesting thought of how to market to all cultures individually  in one course if we all do in fact have unique “cultural DNA.”

Hope Vizla- I have worked a lot with disabled populations and their disabilities play a big role in how they interact with the world. The individuals would get together with other individuals with disabilities in the workforce, for Special Olympics, they would have their own subculture. It was more accepting of people with disabilities. They’d laugh and have their caretakers and not care who was watching when they danced the “funky chicken.” It is a fun environment innocent. I’m not sure about the mental health aspect not comorbid with the disabilities I’d have to think more about how that could affect culture. I guess it would fall into the family culture like Kate Charles’s example of the twins who had not met their father and one who was like the father he never met. Let’s say for example he had a mental health issue that genetically was from his father. Let’s say anxiety and he was raised in a boisterous family but was an introvert and didn’t relate to that culture.
Rachel Brown- When I read your post I thought “wow eLearning is an inferior form of ed.” That is a little harsh.

This is a great conversation thread! I started writing and then stepped away for a few hours to have dinner with the family and came back to so many more ideas and posts.
I feel that culture is a mixture of what you have witnessed, the people you have known or encountered, the places you have traveled along with your beliefs, familial situations, and experiences. I feel like my culture is in a constant state of flux, always changing, growing and shaping me into the person I am today and will be tomorrow and while I agree with Gary Fine when he says that culture is shared by “members of an interacting group” I still believe there are very individualistic attributes as well.  Growing up with several sets of parents over the course of my childhood and teenage years and at one point having no parents have impacted my idea of culture significantly and made me into the kind of person who can adapt quickly to new cultures and loves experiencing life through the eyes of others.
While I used to think of eLearning as being a strictly online course with discussion posts to communicate, I have recently discovered it takes more than an internet connection and a computer to be a part of an eLearning community. Like Marion stated, “there needs to be an attempt to engage the learner through activities, discussions, interactions, etc.” and those interactions and activities often have a way of reflecting each person’s culture. I feel that each person’s culture is reflected in the way we learn, especially in the online environment. There are many instances in online course discussions where I have witnessed a clique form in the discussion boards or other times the posts were very similar to Facebook posts which I feel is in agreement with Taylor Vaio in her statement that “Americans are more individualistic.” It is interesting how our lifestyles, beliefs and social norms are reflected in the learning environment.  
As for the question posted by Maddie Williams, ""would developing eLearning and teaching models which match to the user's perception promote acceptance to eLearning in different cultures?"" I think the answer is yes. I teach people who work in vehicle maintenance or a parts room capacity and have learned that people are more receptive to me because I have actually worked in a shop or parts room, I know the lingo and can give relatable examples because I understand that culture. I feel the same would be true in other situations and especially in the eLearning environment, it would be useful because people will have a better time relating to the modules and course.

Hi Maddie Williams,
Interesting question in the end. I really appreciated that quote that you put by Kopholklang, that ""culture flashes on the goodness that acknowledges, practices, and passes from one to later generations"". For your last question, my take is that developing eLearning and teaching models that match to the users' perceptions is certainly better than teachings that do not match the users' perceptions. To add onto that, it is important for the users to recognize the instructional designers' intentions on understanding and promoting the users' cultures. I believe that in order for a teaching to be effective, it needs to be a collaboration between the instructional designers and the learners, especially in a highly interactive learning environment such as eLearning. What I meant was that, when the learners are given the flexibilities to express their cultural differences in interactive learnings, and when the learners are actually encouraged to bring in cultural diversity into a collaborative learning environments, the learners will feel appreciated and respected, which in turn could results in learners helping the teachers and other learners to build a supportive and inclusive learning communities.
This is such an interesting point that is worth discussing.

Wow, I am so impressed with everyone’s knowledge! You all are so awesome!  I enjoyed reading everyone’s post.  Sorry for my late reply, I had gone home to the reservation to see my grandmother who is 99 years old and diagnosed with an aggressive brain cancer.  There was no internet or phone service.
My simple definition of culture is our cultivation of what we learn from everyone around us but you all blew my mind with your definitions—from Jacob Cannon’s beliefs, ideas, and traditions, Maddie Williams’s idea of inheriting culture, Caroline Sanchez’s hair analogy (love it), Mallory Fetterolf’s 3 areas of our meaning of culture and Cindy Maez’s positive and negative impact on culture.  You all made me think more. I take in so much from everyone here and I am constantly learning. Thank you.
I think elearning began in the late 80s when the internet (WorldWideWeb) became available to the online world. I remember when the internet became available in Zimmerman library and you could look up anything with results in seconds; there were chat rooms for anything and everything and people learned from other people a new skill, learned about another culture, learned another language, etc. I, now, have friends in Turkey; I learned a little bit of Turkish; I even visited the country all because of the internet and now someone there may know a Navajo word or two. Since then we have progressed to web conferencing, videos, facetime, taking online classes.  Like John Johnson, this is my first time taking an online class and it has been an eye opener, maybe it’s my age, but I’m finding myself trying to figure out stuff that I feel I should already know being that I work in the library and we always keep up with technology. It took me forever to figure out the headset to work with my computer in hopes that my web conferencing would work when we first met online.  Sheesh! 
Which leads me to Maddie Williams’s question, would developing eLearning and teaching models which match to the user's perception promote acceptance to eLearning in different cultures.  Yes, I think it can but I’m on the same wave length as Linda Miller regarding costs and the complexities. It depends on the situation.  It worked for the kids who did online learning in the Australian video. There weren’t many children and I wondered about the costs involved to get the school going and for it to be successful.  I went home this past weekend and I wasn’t able to receive internet or phone service on the reservation.  As I watched the video, I thought about the possibility of a replication of an online component on the reservation but that poses so much difficulty in funding, getting phone service to some houses or communities and then knowing the Navajo culture and integrating that within the teaching model, so complex.
I spoke with someone the other day about generations and technology.  The person said my generation (I’m 55) uses Facebook for reconnecting with old friends from college and family; we knew what it was like to not have a computer or iPhone; we would prefer to call and use email and even mail a letter. His generation (age 25) uses texting and other social media like tweeter, Instagram, some Facebook and Tumblr (fandoms) and they’re savvy with technology and not afraid to use it.  The current generation relies on technology, handheld devices, use snapchat in place of texting and Facebook and they may be more cognizant of their safety on the internet and protect themselves using snapchat so it doesn’t get saved and used against them. They have fake Facebook accounts, one for their small circle of friends and one for family, friends not in their circle (parent’s friends, teachers, sibling’s friends) and public. That in itself is a lot to think about when teaching, the teaching models used and considering the integration of culture in elearning. ",1,0,1,0,3,11,4,3,1,7,52,0.71

Hello Joanne Kelso,
I like your question about how to overcome the generational differences and have a lot of experience in this. I train various computer systems to people who have worked most of their lives with their hands or operating equipment. Technology is not only frustrating to them, but they are so afraid to mess something up that it takes tons of patience and encouragement to get them to try to use it. I have learned to find things they are interested in and start by showing them how to use Google or something relevant to their lives to help them gain confidence. I can usually build lessons based on their interests, needs, and skills to help them learn to take chances and try new things. I am amazed at how much progress we can make when I stop focusing on the end result and just help them to explore areas of interest until they are more comfortable and ready to tackle the programs they need to learn for their job.",0,2,0,0,0,5,4,1,0,0,54,0.74

Thanks Mallory Fetterolf and Laura Lucero for sharing experiences.  I like your idea Laura Lucero of starting with something familiar or relevant that the user is knowledgeable about or is interested in searching.  I work with people (homeless, older people and some people who don't own a computer or phone) in the library who come up to the desk asking how to look up something because they don't know how to use the computer. They also don't know we have computers to use for an hour a day so we register them and we'll try to show them how to use the mouse, how to navigate the internet, how to set up email etc. Often they do think they're going to break something, sometimes this takes consultation until they feel a bit comfortable with the computer. They eventually figure it out and they come back often with this new found knowledge and connecting to the world.  :)
Mallory Fetterolf...my mom is in the same boat trying to learn technology. My mother is 77. I was actually surprised at how fast she learned how to post on Facebook from her phone after I explained what to do via phone call. I tried to explain wireless, data usage, updates but that went over her head.  :)  She doesn't have a computer and she would like to learn but she says it would only frustrate her because no one would be around to help. She said the younger generation get frustrated and don't want to help because they're always in a hurry. They press a button, type, and press something else and they tell you the information and go without explaining.

Maddie Williams, 
I love that you clarified that culture is not inherited, rather it is learned throughout your life! There is a distinct difference in the generational cultures and their approach to eLearning. I think that we as eLearning Designers can do a better job of catering to that difference. eLearning focuses on closing the geographical distance but does little to cover the generational differences. Much of the difference between generational cultures is a polarization of values from the previous generation. When done thoughtfully, I think eLearning can bridge that gap and encourage collaborative learning for all ages of students.

I think culture is the roadmap by which we see, understand and navigate the world. It is concurrently specific to an individual and a linkage to others who share the same background, beliefs and learned behaviors (both overt and covert). Culture is almost entirely nurture based, as we learn through both explicit instruction and implicit behaviors of those around us. But I do wonder if there are parts of our personal cultures that are hardwired. For example, I decided to become a vegetarian at the age of 7. I am the only vegetarian in my family and no one I was exposed to at an early age was vegetarian. Once I made the link from what was on my plate to a living being I was not interested. Now, I definitely seek experiences and interactions that reflect the related values and behaviors…even though I’m uncertain where the outlook & behaviors came from in the first place. I’m torn even mentioning this as a cultural factor, but it does affect how I see, understand and navigate the world—and since that is my definition I’m including it.
 E-Learning is any learning that is done using electronic media rather than a face-to-face setting. At this point, I think I would even include non-internet based correspondence classes as they are likely to submit items via email or upload.
Maddie Williams's Question: Would developing E-Learning and teaching models which match to the user's perception promote acceptance to E-Learning in different cultures?
 Yes and no. It would depend heavily on the type of class, the subject matter and the goal of the learning experience. In a local college class this, to my understanding, would work very differently than if we were creating training modules for a multinational organization.
 Regardless of I think that initially, matching the e-learning to the understood culture could ease the way into e-learning. It might be appropriate in introductory courses or modules—allowing students new to e-learning to engage more fully in the process. But ultimately we could lose out on learning if we don’t provide learners with the opportunity to negotiate cultural differences.",1,0,0,4,0,12,6,5,3,1,57,0.78

Erica,
Interesting point about the hardwired aspect of culture.  Your story about becoming a vegetarian at an early age makes us question; why, at such an early age, without others around to model the benefits, would a child choose to do this?  Your story has striking similarities to a family member, who also announced they would become the only vegetarian in the family at an early age and remain one into adulthood. 
I agree with your point that culture is nurture based, and I would think you may have been nurtured to evaluate, question and believe in yourself, which enabled you to make this lifestyle choice.

 Abigale Griego ,"I could relate to David Matsumoto’s definition of culture. “The set of attitudes, values, beliefs, and behaviors shared by a group of people, but different for each individual, communicated from one generation to the next.”  In my experiences with family and friends within the Hispanic culture, my educational responsibilities are not recognized as high priority compared to family and friend events and responsibilities. There is not much understanding about what it takes to study and little empathy for the deadlines that are required of me to complete my education. I understand that there are family responsibilities that must come first, but I have little help juggling many hats. Because of a death in the family, my family responsibilities have since increased. I often feel like I am replacing family with school work, and I get a guilty feeling even though I realize the benefits to being educated.
I was curious to see if my reality of culture and education were similar. I found several resources that explain the culture of Hispanics within an education system.
An Eric Digest publication identifies cultural values that may impact the learning processes of Hispanic-American students. Family commitment is paramount, and the article described how a female Hispanic is perceived as nurturing and self-sacrificing. That certainly fit my reality of culture.
Moving to the textbook, I was able to identify my preferences regarding online learning. The following struck me as important:
•	Co-mentoring
•	Learner support
•	UDL
•	Feedback based assessment
•	Social Presence as a strong prediction of learner satisfaction

Logan Raider ,"RE: Maddie Williams's definition of culture and eLearning
Personally, I find it difficult to grasp the simple concept of culture because of its complexity. What adds to this complexity is that there are various sizes of culture. For example, the population of people who are significantly taller than an average person is less than those who are graduate students. As you mentioned, it is vital to be mindful of one’s cultural programing to in turn identify cultural differences. This is especially important when designing instruction for a specific culture (e.g., West Africans).",0,0,2,0,0,8,3,3,0,0,61,0.84
 Debi Duran ,"RE: Respond to Maddie Williams's initial post!
My initial definition for both culture and E-Learning is the following:
Culture is made up of the different experiences, interactions, and exposure one has encountered in  life. It can be influenced by a variety of things such as   family, friends, religion, education, environment, occupation, socioeconomic background, race, gender,  etc.  From these influences, it can dictate a persons' values, rituals, and traditions they have been accustomed to. 
After reading Chapter 2 from our class textbook, I learned culture has a  connection with cognition as well.  ""Culture shapes the cognitive processes of systems that transcend the boundaries of individuals.""(Gunawardena, Frechette, & Layne, 2019, pg.22) Because every participant in a collaborative setting plays a key role in the learning process, it is just as important to understand the cultural environments each person comes from. These cultural factors play a key role on how learners interact with one another when problem solving or gaining knowledge as a learning community. In retrospect, culture provides valuable resources and guidance when accomplishing goals as a group. 
E-Learning is a type of learning done virtually rather than face to face instruction. This type of learning requires a digital device and Internet connection in order to have access to the course. E-Learning can be convenient to the learner because it allows them to manage the course around their schedule. Furthermore, it allows students and instructors to participate in a course from different parts of the world. Therefore, classes can be made up of a diverse group in which culture plays a key role in student/instructor collaboration.
Maddie Williams's Question: Would developing E-Learning and teaching models which match to the user's perception promote acceptance to E-Learning in different cultures?
Great question! I was thinking towards a question like this, basically how could E-Learning accommodate each learner and their cultural background. So to answer your question, yes I think developing it to where it would match each user's perception would promote acceptance of E-Learning in various cultures.
As we have learned from the assigned reading, Globalized E-Learning Cultural Challenges, the design of the course is just as important as the actual content.""The purpose is to build mutual accommodation and respect for the culture of others in order to reach academic success."" (Edmundson, 2007, pg.10) This not only depends on the language being used within the course, but also how the course is designed for the learner. An example is how red text to the Chinese culture is interpreted as a ""warning"", in which changes how they interpret the context just because of the color it was presented in. Another great example was that Arabic language is read from right to left instead how native English speakers read left to right. These are just two examples on how building a culturally-sensitive OLE (Online Learning Environment) is significant to the learning experience. 
If E-Learning was capable of matching each user's perception, this would help breakdown those barriers that are encountered in an OLE. I am curious to see if anyone has any ideas on how this could be possible or if it has happened with E-Learning? ",1,1,0,0,2,12,7,5,0,4,62,0.85
  George Smith ,"RE: Culture and e-Learning
This is quite an interesting discussion on what culture means to each of us and the ways in which it influences our actions, beliefs, ideals, etc.. For the most part, I agree with Maddie Williams's definition of culture in that we are all products of our environment and that we are sculpted individually by the circumstances and experiences of our lives. Indeed, most of us are predefined (both internally and externally) by the cultures in which we were brought up. As an American, I am well-aware of the ways in which values/beliefs such as self-sufficiency, individualism, and 'manifest destiny' have influenced my development and worldview. While I strive to be aware of my cultural biases and control for them, upon introspection I often find that they are still highly prevalent in the way in which I interact with the world around me. 
Additionally, the definition (and reflections) on culture from many of you mirrors my own in that it suggests the development (and prevalence of) wisdom within our respective communities. While we all have unique upbringings, belief structures, and identities, a common thread that I have noticed is that these values and beliefs about culture can often be similarly applied to those who we deem to be ""wise"" within our communities. We discuss aspects of knowledge, community-mindedness, and norm-expression, which are all discussed in our readings this week regarding wisdom, 'wise communities,' and the WISCOM framework. To me, culture and wisdom go hand-in-hand. Culture, in a general framework, sets the standard for who we are, strive to be, and what is expected of us within various social groups and roles. As such, someone who encompasses these beliefs, ideals, etc., is seen as 'wise' due to their abilities to navigate and communicate within these roles/norms. I am curious, therefore, about the universiality of wisdom across communities; as we saw in Gunawardena, Frechette, & Layne (2019), wisdom is a concept that is recognized across cultures and communities throughout the world (with varying definitions and expectations) and while there is a common thread across these definitions, I cannot help but assume that someone who is deemed 'wise' in one culture may not be similarly seen in another. In this way, wisdom, like culture, is contextually-dependent.
In terms of e-Learning, I would agree that it is a form of education that occurs within the digital/online environment (as many of you have stated). Simply put, it is distance education supported by a digital communication medium. For me, I do not see the distinction between ""learning"" and ""e-Learning"" as relevant anymore considering the speeds at which we can interact online these days; the idea of e-Learning (to me) suggests asynchronous and piecemeal learning within an online framework which, while relevant a decade ago, is not representative of the capabilities of today. 
To elaborate, connectivity today allows us to communicate in real-time across the world. This goes far beyond simply chatting or a Skype call in that we can now work collaboratively on large, data-intensive processes regardless of geographic distance. A scientist in China can control a robot on the US East Coast with little-to-no lag time between command and execution; when it comes to education, this means that we can learn together as a class with minimal technical problems and complete even the most robust assignments in real-time (controlling for any logistical issues of course). 
There is the issue (opportunity) of culture within the e-Learning environment that we must discuss. While we have discussed (and attempted to minimize) the opportunities of e-Learning within the contemporary online environment, this has simply allowed us to better examine/appreciate the differences in personal culture/learning preferences of learners. Without the limitations of 'classic' e-Learning, we are now able to experience online learning on the same terms as learning in the classroom wherein we can engage with individuals as more than a name on the screen in some theoretical place we have never seen or (perhaps) ever heard of. 
On a final note, I agree with Rachel Brown that e-Learning strikes me as a ""buzzword"" from a time past when organizations learned the potential of decentralized and digitally-driven education in the workplace. As suggested above, the term ""e-Learning"" feels foreign and clunky as I don't feel that it adequately captures the essence of online/distance learning as an equal to traditional classroom learning. Perhaps this is from my upbringing which looked upon online education with derision as an inferior form of education to in-person learning.",0,1,0,1,2,19,4,6,2,2,63,0.86
 John Johnson ,"RE: Respond to Maddie Williams's initial post!
For this exercise, I wanted to see what my ideas about culture and eLearning were without having read any of the assigned readings in order to see how my conceptions of them changed within the new context of this class. It has been interesting to watch how my definitions become more complex as my understanding of the studies around these two topics changes.
Culture: Original definition
A combination of practices, traditions and behavioral norms adhered to by a group of people that consciously or unconsciously tie them to / identify them as a part of a defined group.
Culture: Updated Understanding
What struck me most was Vigotsky's conceptualization of ""development as the transformation of socially shared activities into internalized processes."" In this way, culture is taught in an interphyscological way (between people), and also intraphsychologically (within ourselves as individuals). Although this was part of the cultural-historical perspective on learning section (Gunawardena 2019, page 18), it's interesting to consider how much of culture is tacit (unspoken, but agreed upon by engaging within that culture) and how much of it is explicit (something you knowingly and willfully engage in).The WisCom framework attempts to incorporate this understanding by including an emphasis on the influence of culture and context within learning (Gunawardena 2019, page 21), and what what I was attempting to capture by noting that we are consciously or unconsciously tied to it. It seems the more we are aware of our own cultural underpinnings, the more conscious and inclusive we can be of others'.
I especially appreciated the Zulu maxim ""a person is a person through other persons"" (Gunawardena 2019, page 45).  Kate Charles, I wonder if this is something similar to what you meant when you said that although your values stay the same, the culture that you interact with is different at work than it is in church. I wonder if this transformation, or perhaps ""code-switching"" (a term that was once meant to describe switching from one language to another based on the setting in linguistics, but has become commonly understood to mean switching your language, dialect, accent, references or cultural norms to fit a specific cultural setting) is something that we all engage in, however subtly, as our culture and values are an inherent part of our personhood, but that the expression of that culture varies based on our environment.
This only becomes more complex as we discuss Goodfellow & Hewling's writing on high and low context settings, which can be used to contextualize interactions and interpret someone's meaning (Goodfellow & Hewling 2005, page 357). Mallory Fetterolf, I wonder if this is also part of what you were referencing when you mentioned intersectional nature of culture.
eLearning: Original Definition
Similar to Annie Mederios, I originally considered eLearning to simply be a curriculum or program of study delivered through methods that are supplied solely online or via the Internet.  
eLearning: Updated Understanding
This becomes ever more complex when you consider that culture, context and social interaction shape learning, including via language, signs and systems (Gunawardena 2019, page 17). What struck me the most is how varied eLearning can be, and how Distance Education and eLearning are not interchangeable. It seems to me that eLearning, in its most basic form, is defined in my original definition, but that it has many components. It seemed that some people thought that eLearning and Distance Ed were the same thing, but I read the case studies between by Goodfellow & Hewling to show just how different they are, where Distance Education followed a more prescribed form of learning, with provided printed materials, set meeting times etc., but the eLearning emphasizes the leveraging of the Internet to ensure that the learning has a very flexible and accommodating learning environment, tailored to their learning preferences. Rachel Brown, I specifically appreciated your thought on this.
I know that we are working on a consensus of what these two definitions should be, and I hope I haven't simply added to the noise here! Thank you all for sharing your thoughts! ",0,0,1,0,2,20,5,11,1,7,64,0.88

Culture
Great to see such energetic harmony from this group’s members with respect to culture.  Thank you all for your thoughts.  Our readings have expanded my perception of culture from ethnic, geographic, socioeconomic, educational background, art, language.  As I learn more about the factors that influence culture, I am feeling humbled knowing it is dynamic, ever-changing and redefining me as I react to and engage with the world around me.
Clair raised a strong thought-provoking concept of cultural factors that can be genetically passed on such as “a predisposition to anxiety, bipolar, albinism, cleft palate, intellectual disability…all those genetic factors can play a huge role in your culture.”  Having a loving or professional connection with someone afflicted with a predisposition, is just one example of how certain cultural factors can expand and redefine our perceptions of this ever-evolving concept of human culture.  
eLearning
Having worked in Audiovisual/Instructional Media support services in the past and present, we routinely promote the concept of utilizing emerging formats into our service support philosophies.  As Rachel Brown expressed, I to share the idea that eLearning is the current term or concept for distance education.  eLearning is unique as it enables numerous communities to collaborate in real-time while utilizing a variety of formats to maximize audience comprehension and promote dynamic teaching styles.  In present day, eLearning utilizes the internet to connect networks of people around the world.  It is a progressive means of knowledge sharing which can influence efficient teaching learning and even promote social change and solve pressing problems.
How culture and eLearning are related
The internet and its ability to connect people around the world and share knowledge marks a unique period in human existence.  The opening of our text powerfully sets the stage with respect to how culture and eLearning are related.  Time and space no longer limit how we interact with one another.  Technologies, particularly the Internet, have connected humanity across countries and cultures with profound implications on how we think, communicate and learn (Gunawardena, Frechette, Layne 2019).  As Caroline Sanchez suggested, I agree, we do develop our own unique cultures within online communities as we notice in the OILS course.  We actively develop more awareness of our classmates’ communication styles while we exercise sensitivity to expand our knowledge of understanding of the group dynamic and the instructional content.
Maddie Williams’s Question: 
Would developing eLearning and teaching models which match to the user's perception promote acceptance to eLearning in different cultures?""
I believe eLearning can gain acceptance in different cultures if Instructional Designer and or Instructor/Content Expert exercise cultural sensitivity in design and reflection of the quality of audience/instructor interaction.  Sustaining objectivity is critical as stagnation can limit conceptual designs for unique culturally diverse audiences and functions.  Instruction that promotes learning across cultures seeks to accommodate diverse perspectives and preferences by following the principles of universal design for learning (UDL) rather than anticipate individual learner differences upfront.  These principles emphasize flexibility and learner choice. (Barajas & Higbee, 2003).  As we design with rearguard to our audience’s perception, review, evaluate, revise and remain engages as learners of design concepts while exercising cultural sensitivity, eLearning can and will gain acceptance.

I liked this point that you brought up because it seems key to effective online communication.  We actively develop more awareness of our classmates’ communication styles while we exercise sensitivity to expand our knowledge of understanding of the group dynamic and the instructional content. Beyond Netiquette, we have to be keenly aware of how our classmates communicate to us and how our communication is received. Virtual classroom dynamic is real and it can have a major influence on our learning. We need a sense of belonging in the learning community as much as we need to understand the content.",0,0,1,0,0,7,1,3,0,1,69,0.95

Caroline Sanchez,
Thank you for enlightening our class with your stimulating perspectives.
You really make strong point that is critical to an effective leaning process, which is establishing a sense and feeling of belonging.  The human factor seems simple, but it provides us with validating reassurance and motivates progress and productivity.
Thank you,

Caroline Sanchez,
I agree that communication, especially in a text, is a two-way street. One side has to effectively communicate avoiding the potential to be misunderstood. The other side needs to be open-minded and ask for clarification if not understanding. I'll reread my posts and think I sound rude or blunt, so I have to try to explain the intention or rewrite it all together. I am a fan of using an emoji here and there. What do you think? Do you think emoji are appropriate for an online master's program?
As I was typing this I thought that instead of having to log into a collaborate session it would be pretty neat if there was a zoom type function embedded into all discussions like a webcam conversation in a chat room. Even better than that could be a talk to text translator. So when the ""zoomish"" conversation was happening the computer could type it for us. That would be amazing. 
If we had that capability then there would be less misunderstanding or rather more clarification.

I have had to do extra research on UDL. The UDL design is universal to the point of capturing all individuals. That confused me because I have always believed that you should know your audience, and design curriculum with the audience in mind. I had to understand how UDL included cultures of diversity. I found a toolkit for UDL that enables you to log into a sample course. The sample made so much sense.
My understanding became clear after capturing the first page of an activity in the sample course.
The adjectives alone (icons and link named after adjectives) made things clear. Here are samples:
Listen, lookup, translate, consider, investigate, process, review, extend, overview.
There are Feedback to Student and Check My Work links. There is a Notes, Whiteboard, and Glossary menu item. Teacher Notes and Flag Student options are available. Page Highlights, Main Ideas, Big Ideas are other options.
Students are given options to activities. For instance, they are asked to make word cards for vocabulary words. The student can use images, audio and text to create word cards.
