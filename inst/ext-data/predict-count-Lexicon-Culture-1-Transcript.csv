"Janet Smith ","Culture:  The whole complex of traditional behavior which has been developed by the human race and is successfully learned by each generation, Margaret Mead (1932).  I like this definition of culture, because of the broad view it presents.  Culture can include beliefs and rules, but at the same time include education and stability. Different cultures will have their own values, because that is what determines their identity.  eLearning is not straight forward, because you can't just develop a course for everyone.  There are different education, learning, and usage styles in technology that must be adopted to the culture it is presented to.  This will influence your development processes, and learning outcomes for the prospected learners.  As a developer you have to understand the culture you are working with, and learn how to help them succeed as students in your program.      ",3,0,0,0,0,5,3,1,0,1,32,0,0

"Tyler Stepp ","In reflecting on this thread, I think all of these definitions have weight to them. I feel like Mead’s (1970) definitions of post, pre, and configurative definitions provide a broad range of our culture in relation to age. I also find Matsumoto's 1996 definition interesting as well but it outlines that culture can be shared by a group, but can be interpreted differently by an individual. Finally I think that there could perhaps be some interesting parallels of these with Organizational Culture – Harris & DeSimone, 1994 and Cyberculture - Gunawardena, et al. (2009). When I hear cyber culture I think of primarily of interactions online, but what seems consistent between the two is certain beliefs, behaviors, and norms are used a frames of reference for basis of interaction.  While perhaps closer to the spectrum of Harris & DeSimone (1994) definition of organization culture I think of military culture. When people join the military they come from all walks of life and may have different viewpoints, attitudes and belief systems.  As soldiers train they begin to adopt, or adjust specific behaviors, and customs and norms. While reflecting on these definitions of culture it presents an interesting challenge to create a good virtual or online learning environment (OLE). Another reason we want to be mindful of culture is ]\because it can also affect the course climate of the learning environment. Reflecting back to the military it was pretty much people had to integrate and/or adapt or no longer be part of the team. In the civilian world this isn’t an option. Much like being a musician going to a show, we have to know who our audience is, and tailor our work around the audience. Building on both What Janet Smith and Valerie White mentions we generally have to adapt how we teach in OLE’s. Reflecting back on Mead’s (1970) definition, it isn’t just regional differences, we also have to have cultural considerations on age and consider how they will impact our interactions in courses that are online. Just as a general question to everyone(and please let me know if this puts us too far off the topic), do you think it’s possible to tailor an instructional design for an online course that could be adopted universally across multiple cultures?   ",7,0,0,0,0,18,5,5,2,2,48,11,0.234042553191489

"Marissa Craig","I agree with Tyler Stepp, I think that each distinct definition of culture has some aspect of truth to it. And I think the applicability of any given truth depends on which culture or cultural aspect you are discussing. It is interesting to note that often times it seems that we are living in disparate cultures with conflicting ideologies or cultural actions. I know I personally touched on this in my cultural programming response, but I've seen it reflected here in this thread as well. The American ideal of individualism is at direct odds with the American Military ideals of functioning as a single unit. The collectivistic culture of many Eastern cultures is well documented in literature as being at odds with the individualistic culture that immigrants (or their children) adopt as Americans. I wonder if anyone can speak to competing cultures in other places, or if this phenomenon is unique to places that have tried to become a melting pot/soup bowl? Also, I'm unsure if this a newer construct-as we become more global and fluid-- or one that has been faced for many generations? That, I think is the one piece missing from all the definitions we looked at, the idea that competing cultures lead to truly individualized concepts of what one's culture is. I think that the beauty of e-learning is that the same material could be covered in different ways within the same time span. What if learners started an e-learning class with an assessment of their learning preferences and then had the choice to choose a path that followed that learning preference or diverged from it? We won't all learn the exact same things from this class, no matter the method of delivery. So why not create several paths through the material and allow those from different cultures or with different learning preferences to move through the class differently? While it isn't truly personalized, e-learning offers a platform that would allow us to get a little bit closer to individualized learning for all. ",9,0,0,0,0,17,4,7,2,1,49,16,0.340425531914894

It's HARD to do this, at least currently, without programming a branch or path for each learner's individual circumstance. Culture can definitely play a role, but so can the individual's knowledge level, available time for learning, purpose for taking the course, and many other factors. I struggled within the Department of Energy to appropriately assess hundreds of different learners' knowledge levels and motivations for taking the course, not to mention their backgrounds and culture. DOE has employees from all over the world and some have worked there for decades and some for only a few months. I have million dollar idea, if only I knew computer programming! It would be an introductory survey at the start of an online course that could ask pertinent questions to the content and delivery, and then customize the content for the learner afterward. I know the technology exists, but in Storyline and Captivate, this would be a programming nightmare. You'd have to add so many variables, layers, and objects that I would lose my mind. I'd love to hear from everyone else about their experience with online course creation--how do you try to make a one-size-fits-all course when that's really not what learners want? How to you take into account all of the above situations and make a course that suits everyone's needs?

"Lorrie O'Malley","Hi Marissa Craig - There are a lot of great reflections here. I think you're right that there's a real strength to e-learning in that the learner can potentially have quite a bit of autonomy in the way she or he approaches the material. I remember being struck by the reflections of the GA for a course I took with Dr. Jackson last year. While I had been considering e-learning a necessary evil and inferior to face-to-face courses, she spoke about how much more she felt she learned in online courses, where she had the opportunity to consider her responses in discussions as long as she felt she needed to, without being excluded by a live discussion that carried on without her. 
A couple things you wrote brought up some new questions for me. First, the idea of the different paths through the course rang a bit of a an alarm bell for me as an instructional designer - just thinking about the time commitment! - but also I wonder how that would impact the social cohesion in the online group?  Second, in considering your thoughts about individualized learning, I wonder if we are, in this ongoing discussion, conflating the notion of ""learning styles"" with cultural differences - should we make a distinction?

"Marissa Craig","Hi All, When I suggested various paths I wasn't thinking of completely asynchronous and totally individualized paths through the material. Rather, I was considering the idea that there could potentially be no more than 2 or 3 options for learners to choose from. One example might be that those from high context cultures might prefer a path that included video and audio conferencing, much as we have here, whereas, those from low context cultures might prefer and glean as much or more from discussion boards, and be more comfortable with that style of learning. Of course, there would be many other factors involved in which ""path"" learners choose. Potentially, these could all be separate classes as well-- the information on expectations and learning tasks would just need to be clearly described to allow learners to chose the ""best"" section. 
As to the confusion between learning styles and culture, I think there are a couple of things to consider. First, is that we if we are drawing a hard line between learning style and cultural expression/mores then we need to account for a wide variety of personality traits and varying social abilities as well. To me, while it is important to study each of these aspects individually, each alters a learner's relationship with a learning situation. Perhaps I am simply woefully uninformed and ignorant of the way learning actually works, but I'm not sure if it completely matters that if I prefer to learn alone because I believe that is my ""learning style"","" or if it is because independence and solo success was a cultural expectation or if I have social anxiety, or if all three are the case, if the combination of the way I view the world, myself and my learning helps create a barrier when approaching learning tasks.
Certainly, there is a distinction between learning styles and culture. But I think even when considering the impact of any single aspect of an experience we have to consider that a learner is still a whole person and the identified aspect is not functioning in a vacuum. Especially given the large number of people who seem to be navigating through competing cultural messages.

"Cynthia Acosta","The flow of this thread topic originated from Mead’s 1932 definition and moved on to include additional definitions of culture she has formed. Then Valerie White referenced Matsumoto’s 1996 definition.  Based off the courses I have taking for this OILs program and specifically, Dr. Gunawardena’s Cross Cultural Adult Learning, I feel that it is necessary to frame the definition of culture as relative for the subject.  Hence, for Global eLearning or Culture and Global eLearning, and review of the course description I feel the definition should have some focus to sociological culture perspectives.  I feel our definition should point to aspects as aesthetics, education levels, comfort and abilities to electronic learning or technology and what community or social organization that we want to focus on.   I can appreciate the Mead believed that human behavior is learned and that in the elearning environment we need to quickly focus the individual and group on the behavior expected to create the learning environment.  Matsumoto’s also focuses us to that group and individual behaviors.  
I might be merging the thoughts of eLearning and culture a bit in my mind or perhaps I am trying to focus this request for definitions in reverse order than they were presented.  So rather than define culture first, I want to focus on eLearning first.  (on a side note, I wonder if the flow of discussion would be focused differently if the words were listed in reverse?)
Because this assignment is to create definitions for eLearning and Culture, I offer the following:
eLearning:  The creation of an electronic environment that incorporates technology for the use of academic development.
Culture:  An accumulation of impactors that form and shape a person’s being or entity and form the social environment of the group that the person is associating with.
What I hope to gather from this tasking in module one is the framework for the course and the ability to concentrate on remainder of the course in that direction.  I believe this course should help me understand theory as related to creating and participating in an eLearning environment and be cognizant and considerate to others based on cultural impacts from each individual and the group.

"Skyler Aslin","To expand further upon the topic of identity and respect for others, I would like to comment that individualistic Western cultures feature a ""I-You"" stance, while Asia, the ""We-They"" stance is the main norm. This is illustrated by Ozkul and Aoki, who found in Japan, teachers and students prefer video conference lectures to impersonal text. In countries with a low-context environment, the use of text and independent learning may prevail. But in Asian countries, with high-context cultures, lectures and group activities seem to be more of the norm. 
To design e-learning for a global audience requires us to be cognizant of the situation of low-context versus high-context. In cyber culture, there exists a set of shared experiences which all online users can have as a result of being connected to each other through the Internet. To design e-learning for any audience requires an understanding of this type of ideoculture. From this stepping stone of cyberculture, different kinds of course material can be produced as a result. This is partially an answer to Tyler Stepp' question regarding whether a universal course can be developed. I say that it can be developed, as we are all humans sharing a connection to each other through a certain type of medium, of varying degrees of familiarity to the medium, it's capabilities, and it's limitations. One just needs to find the common ground, in this case, cyber culture, which can be observed through certain net cafes in varying places around the world, as well as in corporations that have a cubicle room filled with computers. 
To build off of Tyler Stepp' music analogy, and to summarize my post, I would like to say that western audiences feature more of a duet setup in terms of learning environments, with one person playing second fiddle to the star player of the show. Eastern audiences feature more of a orchestral setup, with the strings on one side, and the winds and percussion each taking their own space and influence in the show. E-learning is similar to learning music, because while most musicians can read sheet music, not all musicians can understand the details behind every instrument's capabilities and sounds. One needs to take on the role of a conductor in order to be an instructional designer for e-learning on a universal basis.

"Nina Lockhart","I really appreciate Tyler Stepp' music analogy and Skyler Aslin's then description of eLearning in western versus eastern cultures as instruments in an orchestra as a whole and as individual instruments. That resonates with me.
Marissa Craig brought up a great point. She said, ""We won't all learn the exact same things from this class, no matter the method of delivery."" I think this points back to outside influences/our individual culture and programming. Just as each student brings something independent to the ""learning table"" that is the classroom or in our case, the online environment, each student also walks away with different learned concepts. So it seems to me that eLearning needs to offer flexibility just as the students need to be open minded and humble. I am starting to see how interrelated culture and eLearning truly need to be in order for learning to occur online.
I see Mead's definition of culture is discussed above. But I found myself drawn to David Matsumoto's definition just as Valerie White states. I particularly like that Matsumoto acknowledges groups of people and the individual, as well as how culture is communicated through generations. Overall, defining culture seems to be very nebulous but I feel Matsumoto's definition allows room for a broad range of ideas.
To answer Tyler Stepp' question about a course developed universally: I would like to think such a course can be developed. I think a significant amount of research and cultural consideration is needed. But I do think it could be developed as like Skyler Aslin says, ""we are all humans sharing a connection to each other.."" If students in a class can keep the same goal of learning in mind, developing an universal class should be able to happen.

"Frances Lopez","Hi Janet Smith,
I like how your definition of culture addresses two aspects that I feel are important to include in our overall definition. Like you, I believe that culture is passed on amongst generations and should encompass a broad range of things that makeup a being, such as values, beliefs, rules, education, etc. I do wonder, however, how Mead's definition would change if the transmission of culture is not ""successfully learned by each generation,"" because some individuals may only adopt pieces of their culture and add on other aspects to create their subculture. When I read that piece of Mead's definition, it sounds so absolute. What do you think?

"Frances Lopez","As I read the material and the discussions above, I found that aspects of the different culture definitions stood out to me. I agree that culture is “shared by a group of people, but different for each individual (David Matsumoto, 1996);"" is “used to interpret the environment and serve as a guide for all kinds of behavior (Harris & DeSimone, 1994);” and is “used as a frame of reference for the way one looks at, attempts to understand and works with any organization (Ott, 1989).”
On top of this, I feel that culture is a fluid concept that changes throughout one’s life. It’s not static (Hoopes & Push, 1979). You may have believed one thing as you were growing up and after gaining some life experience you now disagree with that one aspect even though you still have overall the same cultural ideas. I think that’s the beauty of culture - you make it what you want it to be whether that’s individually or as a group. 
My definition of e-Learning is very similar to Gina’s mentioned above. For me e-Learning is any type of educational activity set up to enhance learner’s knowledge on a specific topic and transmitted online in any shape, form or activity that will assist the learner in reaching their learning goals, as well as those of the course. 
I’ve come to realize that e-learning is built on the culture of the instructor and designer, as well as the culture embedded within the online platform the material is delivered in. Their culture seeps into the content and is then picked up by the student who may or may not have the same culture. This can change the materials effectiveness in assisting students with thoroughly learning, understanding and acting on the content. This was a big eye opener for me. I never thought about it like this and it made me wonder how my own culture has made its way into the content I teach. This is definitely something I will be mindful of when designing training.

Culture can be embedded in the very platform that is chosen, the way the course is facilitated, and the choice of materials that are offered. One of the reasons, I think, that this is such an important point is that can be largely invisible to those who share that culture, but it can have a big impact on other students who do not. Thanks for sharing - it IS an eye-opener, I agree.

"Alma Cortez","Frances Lopez, I also called attention to the concept of fluidity in my definition of culture, because I think that so many forces can impact how a group of individuals shifts and adapts norms, expectations, and belief structures in response to external and internal forces. I think of the impact on colonialism and also the impact of a tremendous shift in a company culture, for two examples.
The definition of culture is one I spent a lot of time thinking about as a cultural anthropology student, and like many of the students I worked with, I got increasingly frustrated with the inability of language to adequately capture all of the nuance and essential facets of the term. I think the words that I would use to define culture would be that it is a mutually constructed, defined and understood, shared set of beliefs, customs, norms, linguistic conventions, expectations, stratification, and power dynamics. It is at once perpetuated by and constructed by its members, and serves both as a memory system and a method for creating the future. It is something that has huge implications based on how much power is held collectively by a group of individuals, both because culture can be appropriated and also used as a method of erasure. It can be subject to oppression both overt and subversive.

E-learning refers to any type of training or educational activity that is mediated through technology and does not require that the learner and the instructor be in the same physical location, or indeed the same time zone, for learning and instruction to occur.

"Lorrie O'Malley","Hi Janet Smith - It's a good point that developers have to understand the culture of the people they are working with. As as instructional designer myself, I've thought a lot about (and sometimes have been frustrated by) the idea that while this cultural competence is important, the level of the individual is also important. Even within cultures, of course, there are individual preferences. Designing for both - keeping both in mind - is an interesting challenge. ",3,0,0,0,0,2,0,2,1,0,20,34,0.723404255319149
"Victoria Benavidez","I think you did an excellent job of choosing the quote to describe culture. I also think it would be important to add something regarding influences from people and the environment. I think so much of culture is influenced by physical location that it should be included. The concept of culture comes from geography and a definition of culture wouldn't be complete without mentioning this. Also, in regard to people, they are constantly changing and interacting with each other which causes larger shifts in attitudes and beliefs.
I spent four years living in Northwest Spain and I was amazed how much the physical geography influenced everything from their food to vocabulary words. In the Galician language, there are over 70 words to describe the rain. They have words to describe everything from the strength and the frequency to the quantity to the duration. Also to be in an area that was suppressed by a dictator until 1975 has impacted the character of the people. The people are very closed and skeptical of new people. After all, they could have gone to jail for speaking a language other than Spanish where most of their native language was Galician.  
 
This concept of culture can also be taken into a corporation or an institution. Many people talk about the company culture at google which is also influenced by their physical environment and the people who run the business. 
 
In regards to creating a definition for eLearning, I think this is straight forward. The word itself gives the definition. It is learning that takes place through the medium of the internet. I don’t think that there is much that can be added or taken away to make the definition any better.
 
The complexities of this discussion are when describing how the two are related. Each person brings their individual culture into the virtual classroom and each individual contributes to the larger picture. However, we aren’t focusing on the individual but on the group. I think that it would be important to discuss culture sensitivity since we do not know the background and experiences of the people in the classroom. I think that its also important to use words like collaborative and responsive when describing how it works.

"Cameron Garrity","I, too, like Mead's definition of culture; so it is a good starting point. I am much more partial to the definition suggested by Hall and adopted in our text (page 1) - Culture is communication and communication is culture.
We have to be careful not to make our definitions of culture ahistorical, divorced from space and time. As Jaques Derrida describes in Of Grammatology, we understand a concept by drawing a line through it, by its negation. For example, we are compelled to use terms like ""American culture"" - but we have to be precise in the limitations of such a term; the culture of an Inuit family in Alaska is quite different from that of a Scandinavian-origin family of Catholics in North Dakota, though both may watch the same college football games and root for similar teams. There are shared commonalities, and great differences.
In the foreword to Madness and Civilization Michel Foucault writes that if a thing does not communicate, it dies. The same is true of all consciousness and cultures. Our text captures the foundational and mediating aspect of culture in the statement that culture is negotiated and mediated through a communication processes.

"Cameron Garrity","In this regard, I have to say I heartily disagree with the ideas that the ""west"" has an individualistic culture and other countries,such as in Asia, have a more group-oriented culture. What is problematic in this typification - first,explore the concept ""western"": it is clearly not geographical: it breaks down when we think of the geographical edges of this concept. Is the eastern extremity in Istanbul,Turkey? Is Russia ""western""? Where in Siberia does the ""west"" end? Novosibirsk? How about historically? When did the ""west"" come into existence? This origin is often co-located with ""Greek"" civilization. The Greeks were located all around the Mediterranean and many discoveries we think of as ""Greek"" were from parts influenced greatly by Turkey (in turn influenced greatly by countries father east) and African thinking; and came from Greek city-states located in Africa and Asia. Or, consider some ""western"" histories pre-dating Christianity - are the Vikings western? The Druids? It appears that commonly, in strategic terms, we think of ""western"" as the Anglo-American led alliance that includes some European states, but this alliance now includes many former ""eastern"" states. I am trying to make the point that when we try to pin the concept ""western"" down geographically, historically (what years?), it breaks down. The same holds true for ""eastern"" - take India for instance where I was born and where I lived till twenty-seven: I worked for a summer in a rain forest with indigenous forest dwellers who lived a somewhat subsistence life-style with few market interactions, and much fishing, hunting, and slash-and-burn agriculture; and another summer at the National Aeronautical Laboratories with scientists doing supersonic re-entry research using one of the world's largest supersonic wind tunnels. How do we generalize across such groups?
A statement by Heidegger comes to mind - ""We shall fail to understand the mysteriousness of being-human.... if we snatch at value-judgments of any kind."" (Heidegger, An Introduction to Metaphysics). I believe the concepts of ""western"" and ""eastern"", ""group-self"" and ""individualistic-self"" are filled with value-judgments and a search for legitimization of certain historical events such as colonization and plunder of conquered lands' resources.
With all this said, I still find it useful to engage in dialog in which these concepts and ideas (western/eastern, group/individual) are used. I just caution us all to realize their limitations and restrict the applicability of these concepts.

"Lorrie O'Malley","Hi Cameron Garrity - 
This is an interesting perspective. I do resonate with some elements of the points you're making. It's true that these notions (individualistic vs. group oriented, east vs. west) are hard to pin down and vary greatly in the way they are expressed even in a single location, across individuals of different backgrounds and classes. However, I have, myself, experienced living in cultures where it seemed that a great majority of people that I met - whether scientists or cooks, fishermen or lawyers - had the more group-oriented outlook, and this was expressed not only in the way they spoke but also in their societal institutions (the way they organized nursing homes and schools, for example). I'm speaking of my experience in Cuba that I mentioned earlier in this discussion. It almost seems to be that you are arguing against the notion of cultural differences, per se. Is that the case?

"Cameron Garrity","If you read your own statement about great variations , etc., you have essentially negated the idea of a generalized culture; the Cuban institutions you speak of may have been organized as collectives from the Marxist orientations of the revolution. Is this to be described in terms of Cuban culture?
I am not arguing against cultural differences - I am saying that we should be very careful about generalizations. I heard a US sociologist at my university in India in 1978 start his talk by saying that he had only spent three months in India and so had to be careful about his ideas, and then he proceeded to make the most extreme of generalizations about Indian society (he was speaking about an individual-self and a family-self). I heard another very famous Indian economist (a far better speaker) say as a starting humorous line, ""Give me any social science theory and I can prove it wrong in India.""
We have to be very specific about which group, which time in history, etc. when we speak of cultural effects.

"Cameron Garrity","I find myself thinking of eLearning and Learning as very closely allied. At the level of how information is stored in my brain after visual and auditory signals have reached my nerve endings, and certain neural networks formed and protein indicators established to recreate these networks at a future time, does it matter greatly if the original stimulations of photons and electrons that initiated the protein building came from a ""live "" scene or a computer screen? In eLearning we use networks of people and information across great distances and times - books have played a similar role in class-rooms, with lesser interactivity.
In the future, the increasingly interactive nature of eLearning coupled with cybernetic intelligence will transform eLearning qualitatively.

"Marissa Craig","Cameron Garrity, I identify with your conceptualization of e-learning for many subjects. I do believe that there are some topics or subjects that will require hands-on interaction for deeper understanding, but overall the information is transmitted similarly. One thing that you didn't specifically mention that I think relates to your post is that, assuming the e-learning is otherwise culturally sensitive, it has the ability to remove learning barriers. A student who cannot read quickly will benefit from videos or audio recordings, a student who may not interact easily face-to-face may be more willing to engage in an e-setting.

"Dr. Jackson ","I have been really impressed with your perspectives on culture and eLearning and the challenge of defining the two. I want to thank all of you who contributed to the discussion and shared your perspectives.
It is interesting to see which type of culture definition resonates with you. Some of you have posted the difficulties in talking about culture and the stereotyping we do when we talk about it, East vs. West for example. It is also difficult when we dichotomize cultural concepts such as individualism vs. collectivism, or high-context vs. low context. I think we currently live in a world which we can consider hybrid merging several cultures. In the U.S. we have third culture kids whose heritage is a cultural mix. So as you can see, culture is a complex concept to define. We all know culture is constantly changing as well.
I like the new definitions of culture that are emerging in this discussion and encourage you to further explore and consider them. We will discuss further during our web conference tomorrow.

"Lorrie O'Malley","Hi all - 
I'm going to re-post here an email I sent, so we can discuss it if you would like:
I have enjoyed reading this week's discussion - a lot of great insights there. As I was reading, it occurred to me that we could take the opportunity in this class to make a clear distinction between cultural differences in learners and the concept of ""learning styles"".
As many of you know, the theory of ""learning styles""  claims that different students have different modes of learning - such as auditory, visual, or kinesthetic - and that teachers should match their instruction to students' preferred learning mode to optimize learning. This is actually a myth - there is little or no scientific evidence that learning styles exist in this way or that tailoring instruction to these ""styles"" leads to greater learning. This myth is so pervasive, though, that we still hear it all the time, and it may impact our thinking. I've attached an article on this if you are interested in reading more. I know that for some, this may be a surprise.
However, it *is* true that learners differ from each other, of course. People come from different cultures, have different aptitudes, different educational backgrounds, and many other differences that teachers should take into account when they teach or train, design courses, etc. This reality factors into our discussion this week. 
I think Dr. Jackson may speak more to this later. For now, I just wanted to throw it out there and challenge us to think about this distinction as we learn together in the next few weeks.

"Lorrie O'Malley","It’s been a few weeks, so I figured I’d bring us back to our discussion topic: Cultural Factors and eLearning based on Iron & Silk, Culture Shock, and Required Readings. I noted that in our discussions our class very much focused on the videos themselves, and the readings were not mentioned as much. Regardless, there was an interesting development of information exchange and how we should approach learning and teaching in cultures not familiar with our own. In addition to synthesizing last week’s discussion, I have incorporated some of what we have learned in this week.
A notable observation based on group discussion and dialog was the instructors approach to teaching in a new cultural context. Both instructors had seemingly good intentions about learning the respected cultures and customs, but still maintained difficulty in understanding some underlying cultural differences form their own. Each of these instructors took this in different ways: In “Teacher-Mark aka Mark Salzman’s” initial case he sought some compromise; in the simulation Mr. Beasley thought his students were being disrespectful.
Based on what we discussed and the videos, it is evident that both teachers did not fully participate in the immersion of the culture. Likewise, despite the fact that they relocated to these new places, they initially did not full advantage of potential immersion. While both read about these cultures and studied them habitually, that alone was not enough to get them to integrate with the culture they were interacting with. Going back to “communication is culture,  and culture is communication” there may have been more opportunities for them to examine integrate with the existing cultures.
Based on what we’ve learned so far with our projects on incorporating mLearning and India, I would suggest that this module is just as relevant as the previous one. We can read about a culture, but to try understand it, we may benefit most when we are not only immersed, but experience, and communicate with said culture. Perhaps this would be an interesting discussion topic regarding learning new cultures and experiential learning?
Given our current projects emphasis on understanding culture, I think this synthesis may feed into another aspect: there may be different cultural aspects in not only formal and informal settings, but also different communities. I think this ties into our current research on how we need to employ people within the community to make necessary changes if we wish for diffusion to occur.
Bringing this back our discussion, we need to place an emphasis on the importance of humility when interacting with cultures not familiar with our own. Not only that, we need to approach these different cultures with mindfulness. Another area we examined in Mark Salzman and Mr. Beasily’s cases was that people integrated in the community were willing to help them understand the culture.
In Mr. Salzmans case it was Teacher Hei. In Mr. Beasily’s case it was the parents and the community of the school children. In our discussion Teacher Hei actions were debated, but it was noted that she was trying to formally educate Salzman on Chinese culture in efforts for integration. In Mr. Beasily’s case it was the parents of the students that invited him to dinner.
In Rogers’ work Diffusion of innovation (1995) it’s noted that he discusses all the critical components that go into introducing new innovations to different cultures. As Rogers notes, this innovation does not have to be brand new innovation, but a new innovation to the group. When we observe and reflect on our readings about diffusion of innovation, we are trying to figure out how we as instructional designers can introduce new innovations so that they can diffuse across a new culture.
Upon introspection, I would suggest that in both Teacher Hei and the local native families case- they are the change agents for diffusion amongst us in the western world. Perhaps this is another area we should explore when trying to introduce new ideas and innovations amongst other cultures.
As part of this class, we are trying to introduce new ideas to a culture that is not always familiar with our own, and for the most part a western perspective. If we wish to try to integrate new innovations with them, perhaps we should recognize they may want to do the same with us. As defined in our discussions, our tool sets include: Communication, humility, mindfulness and open exchange to new ideas.
I want to dig in more to this topic, and I look forward to your thoughts and exchanges.
Thanks for reading!
